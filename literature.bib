  Abstract                 = {The degree to which osmotic stress changes the volume of mammalian central neurons has not previously been determined. We isolated CA1 pyramidal cells and measured cell volume in four different ways. Extracellular osmolarity (pio) was lowered by omitting varying amounts of NaCl and raised by adding mannitol; the extremes of pio tested ranged from 134 to 396 mosm/kg. When pio was reduced, cell swelling varied widely. We distinguished three types of cells according to their response: "yielding cells" whose volume began to increase immediately; "delayed response cells" which swelled after a latent period of 2 min or more; and "resistant cells" whose volume did not change during exposure to hypo-osmotic solution. When pio was raised, most cells shrank slowly, reaching minimal volume in 15-20 min. We observed neither a regulatory volume decrease nor an increase. We conclude that the water permeability of the membrane of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons is low compared to that of other cell types. The mechanical support of the plasma membrane given by the cytoskeleton may contribute to the resistance to swelling and protect neurons against swelling-induced damage.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to evaluate structural-functional relationships in real time has allowed scanning probe microscopy (SPM) to assume a prominent role in post genomic biological research. In this mini-review, we highlight the development of imaging and ancillary techniques that have allowed SPM to permeate many key areas of contemporary research. We begin by examining the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) by Binnig and Rohrer in 1982 and discuss how it served to team biologists with physicists to integrate high-resolution microscopy into biological science. We point to the problems of imaging nonconductive biological samples with the STM and relate how this led to the evolution of the atomic force microscope (AFM) developed by Binnig, Quate, and Gerber, in 1986. Commercialization in the late 1980s established SPM as a powerful research tool in the biological research community. Contact mode AFM imaging was soon complemented by the development of non-contact imaging modes. These non-contact modes eventually became the primary focus for further new applications including the development of fast scanning methods. The extreme sensitivity of the AFM cantilever was recognized and has been developed into applications for measuring forces required for indenting biological surfaces and breaking bonds between biomolecules. Further functional augmentation to the cantilever tip allowed development of new and emerging techniques including scanning ion-conductance microscopy (SICM), scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM), Kelvin force microscopy (KFM) and scanning near field ultrasonic holography (SNFUH).},

Stimulation of protein kinase C (Pk-C) by tumour promoters such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) produces at day 7 in vitro a similar network after only 20 hr. H-7, an inhibitor of Pk-C, as well as amiloride, which inhibits the subsequent Na+/H+ exchange, reversibly suppress this effect. Activation of the protein kinase A or calmodulin pathway do not result in an increased OL process production. Furthermore, TPA induced proliferation in a subpopulation of OL. We conclude that the stimulation of Pk-C is of utmost importance for OL regeneration.},

  Abstract                 = {Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) agonists provide the potential for treating chronic pain states without CNS effects associated with CB1 receptor activation. Animal models suggest that they act mainly via non-neuronal cells, possibly inhibition of inflammatory cells in the periphery or CNS, or via release of beta-endorphin; however, the clinical relevance and mechanism of analgesic action is uncertain. Here, we demonstrate colocalisation of CB2 with CB1 and the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 in human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons and increased levels of CB2 receptors in human peripheral nerves after injury, particularly painful neuromas. In primary cultures of human DRG neurons, selective CB2 agonists blocked activation of inward cation currents and elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ in response to capsaicin. These inhibitory effects were reversed by GW818646X a CB2 antagonist, and 8-bromo cAMP, but not by SR141716 a CB1 antagonist, or naloxone. Thus CB2 receptor agonists functionally inhibited nociceptive signalling in human primary sensory neurons via a mechanism shared with opioids, of adenylyl cyclase inhibition, but not via mu-opioid receptors. We conclude that CB2 agonists deserve imminent clinical trials for nociceptive, inflammatory and neuropathic chronic pain, in which capsaicin or heat-activated responses via TRPV1 may provide a clinical marker.},

  Abstract                 = {Neurites of superior cervical ganglion neurons from embryonic, perinatal, and adult rats extended at different rates when placed in tissue culture on similar collagen substrata. Using high resolution cinematography and a time-lapse video recording system, we concluded that these differences arise from variations in individual growth cone behavior. Growth cones of embryonic and perinatal neuronal origin exhibited high peak rates of advance and filopodial and lamellipodial excresences. Perinatal cones differed from embryonic ones in that they were somewhat larger, advanced in straighter paths, and retracted less, consequently translocating at 14 to 29 microns/hr compared with 8 to 22 microns/hr for embryonic cones (ranges of 4-hr means). The growth cones of neurons obtained from adult rats had scant cytoplasm and short branched filopodia, lacked definitive lamellipodia, and traversed the terrain at 4 to 13 microns/hr due to lack of high peak rates of advance and more time spent in stationary or minimal advance phases. Periodic pauses lasting 10 to 20 min, occurring every 20 to 90 min, interrupted the forward advance of growth cones of all ages. During pauses or slow forward movement, the growth cone displayed numerous filopodia whereas, during brief episodes when embryonic and perinatal growth cones moved at peak rates of 200 microns/hr or more, the cone periphery was predominantly lamellipodial. We conclude that the predominance of a lamellipodial or filopodial conformation correlates with the rate of growth cone advance and that age-dependent variations in neurite extension rates are related to differences in growth cone form and pattern of translocation. This is the first documentation of differing behavior of single growth cones of neurons of varying developmental ages in culture.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies have reported neuroprotective effects of erythropoietin (EPO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The purpose of the present study was to clarify their influence on neurite outgrowth and regeneration of rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in vitro and to elucidate the expression of corresponding receptors in the rat retina in vivo.Retinal explants from postnatal rats were stimulated with VEGF alone; VEGF in combination with anti-VEGF-receptor (VEGF-R)-2 antibody or T-type Ca2+ channel blocker ethosuximide (ESX); EPO alone; or EPO in combination with anti-EPO-receptor antibody or ESX. The presence of the corresponding receptors in the rat retina was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by immunohistochemistry.EPO induced a stable improvement of neurite outgrowth of RGCs in a dose-dependent manner (5 x 10(-15) M to 5 x 10(-13) M) up to 169\% (P < 0.05). Treatment of the explants with anti-EPO-R antibody (1:80 dilution) and with ESX (5 microM) totally inhibited EPO-mediated effects on RGCs. In comparison, VEGF (50 ng/mL), induced neurite outgrowth of retina explants up to 167\% (P < 0.05), which again was inhibited in the presence of anti-VEGF-R2 antibody or ESX. Transcripts of EPO-R, VEGF-R1, and VEGF-R2 were detected by RT-PCR. Intense immunoreactivity for VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, and EPO-R were found in the RGC layer of the retina.The data demonstrate for the first time that EPO and VEGF have a significant and specific biological effect on neurite regrowth of axotomized RGCs. Therefore, these results imply that EPO and VEGF have not only a neuroprotective but also a neuroregenerative role in ischemic retinal conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Magnetic resonance imaging and optical microscopy are key technologies in the life sciences. For microbiological studies, especially of the inner workings of single cells, optical microscopy is normally used because it easily achieves resolution close to the optical wavelength. But in conventional microscopy, diffraction limits the resolution to about half the wavelength. Recently, it was shown that this limit can be partly overcome by nonlinear imaging techniques, but there is still a barrier to reaching the molecular scale. In contrast, in magnetic resonance imaging the spatial resolution is not determined by diffraction; rather, it is limited by magnetic field sensitivity, and so can in principle go well below the optical wavelength. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging has recently been improved enough to image single cells, and magnetic resonance force microscopy has succeeded in detecting single electrons and small nuclear spin ensembles. However, this technique currently requires cryogenic temperatures, which limit most potential biological applications. Alternatively, single-electron spin states can be detected optically, even at room temperature in some systems. Here we show how magneto-optical spin detection can be used to determine the location of a spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond with nanometre resolution under ambient conditions. By placing these nitrogen-vacancy spins in functionalized diamond nanocrystals, biologically specific magnetofluorescent spin markers can be produced. Significantly, we show that this nanometre-scale resolution can be achieved without any probes located closer than typical cell dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a single diamond spin as a scanning probe magnetometer to map nanoscale magnetic field variations. The potential impact of single-spin imaging at room temperature is far-reaching. It could lead to the capability to probe biologically relevant spins in living cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Although the class II phosphoinositide 3-kinase enzymes PI3K-C2alpha and PI3K-C2beta act acutely downstream of cell surface receptors they have also been localized to nuclei in mammalian cells. As with the class I PI3K enzymes, the relationship between the pools of enzyme present in cytoplasm and nuclei remains poorly understood. In this study we test the hypothesis that PI3K-C2beta translocates to nuclei in response to growth factor stimulation. Fractionating homogenates of quiescent cells revealed that less than 5\% of total PI3K-C2beta resides in nuclei. Stimulation with epidermal growth factor sequentially increased levels of this enzyme, firstly in the cytosol and secondly in the nuclei. Using detergent-treated nuclei, we showed that PI3K-C2beta co-localized with lamin A/C in the nuclear matrix. This was confirmed biochemically, and a phosphoinositide kinase assay showed a statistically significant increase in nuclear PI3K-C2beta levels and lipid kinase activity following epidermal growth factor stimulation. C-terminal deletion and point mutations of PI3K-C2beta demonstrated that epidermal growth factor-driven translocation to the nucleus is dependent on a sequence of basic amino acid residues (KxKxK) that form a nuclear localization motif within the C-terminal C2 domain. Furthermore, when this sequence was expressed as an EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) fusion protein, it translocated fluorescence into nuclei with an efficiency dependent upon copy number. These data demonstrate that epidermal growth factor stimulates the appearance of PI3K-C2beta in nuclei. Further, this effect is dependent on a nuclear localization signal present within the C-terminal C2 domain, indicating its bimodal function regulating phospholipid binding and shuttling PI3K-C2beta into the nucleus.},

Incubation of liposomes treated with alpha-toxin in the presence of PEG with the hydrophobic photo-affinity probe 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-m-[125I]iodophenyl) diazirine (125I-TID) labels monomeric and-predominantly-hexameric forms of liposome-associated alpha-toxin; in the absence of PEG little labeling is apparent. At high concentrations of H+ and Zn2+ but not of Ca(2+)-all of which inhibit calcein leakage-the distribution of label between hexamer and monomer is perturbed in favor of the latter. In alpha-toxin-treated planar lipid bilayers from which excess toxin has been washed away, PEGs and dextrans strongly promote the appearance of ion-conducting pores. The properties of such pores are similar in most regards to pores induced in the absence of nonelectrolytes; the differ only in being more sensitive to "closure" by voltage (as are pores induced in cells). In both systems, the stimulation by nonelectrolytes increase with concentration and with molecular mass up to a maximum around 2,000 Da. We conclude (i) that most of the alpha toxin that becomes associated with liposome or planar lipid bilayers does not form active pores and (ii) that the properties of alpha-toxin-induced pores in lipid bilayers can be modulated to resemble those in cells.},

  Abstract                 = {A major question in developmental neurobiology is how developing nerve cells accurately extend processes to establish connections with their target cells. This problem involves both the nature of cues for growth cone guidance and also the question of how growth cones survey their environment for cues and respond by altering their direction of migration. The filopodia which normally extend from neuronal growth cones have been shown to affect growth cone steering in vitro and it has been proposed that they function in vivo in the detection of and response to guidance cues. This hypothesis could be tested in vivo if growth cones which normally have filopodia could be induced to migrate in their absence. The pair of Ti1 neurones are the first neurones to extend axons through the limb buds of embryonic grasshoppers. We report here an examination of the migration of Ti1 pioneer growth cones deprived of filopodia by culture in agents which disrupt actin microfilaments. Under these conditions, axons continue to extend but a large percentage of growth cones are highly disoriented. Our results indicate that Ti1 filopodia are not necessary for axonal elongation in vivo but that they are important for correctly oriented growth cone steering.},

Relevant references from the advent of this technique in the late 1980s to most recent contributions in 2012 are presented with special discussion on high resolution images. A clear progress especially within the last 5 years can be seen in the field of HR-SECM. Furthermore, we also concentrate on the intrinsic properties of SECM imaging techniques e.g. different modes of image acquisition, their advantages and disadvantages in imaging living cells and strategies for further enhancement of image resolution, etc. Some of the recent advances of SECM in nanoimaging have also been discussed which may have potential applications in high resolution imaging of cellular processes.},

  Abstract                 = {The Bingel-Hirsch reaction consists in the reaction of a bromomalonate with electron-poor π bonds, for example, of carbon materials, yielding cyclopropane derivatives. The reactive nucleophile is generated in situ from the respective malonate using CBr(4) and a base. The resulting cyclopropane moiety links the carbon material's surface atoms covalently with the functional side groups of the malonate. So far, the reaction was limited to fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. Herein, we report on the first application of this reaction type for the surface modification of diamond nanoparticles. The surface of thermally annealed nanodiamond consists of fullerene-like sp(2) carbon atoms which exhibit a similar reactivity as those in the all-sp(2) carbon nanomaterials. It was found that the reaction proceeds smoothly and enables the grafting of a large variety of functional groups to the surface of nanodiamond. The generated nucleophiles are also able to react with carbonyl species on the diamond. This reaction pathway enables the grafting of malonates even on oxidized nanodiamond without prior thermal annealing.},

  Abstract                 = {Nano-BLMs (black lipid membranes) suspending the pores of highly ordered porous silicon substrates have been proven useful for functional investigations of ion channel proteins by electrical readouts. With the aim to monitor the resistive behavior of nano-BLMs spatially resolved in a contact-free manner, we report here on the visualization of nano-BLMs by means of scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM). Silicon surfaces with highly ordered pore arrays were coated with a gold layer and functionalized with octadecanethiol before a droplet of 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC) (2\% w/v) dissolved in n-decane was applied. The topography of DPhPC membranes suspending the pores was stably imaged for hours without mechanical contact using SICM. This suggests that SICM provides a significant advantage over atomic force microscopy, where mechanical interactions occur that easily damage the suspended membranes. Dynamic processes such as spreading and rupturing of membranes were spatially and temporally resolved. Furthermore, SICM was used to individually manipulate membranes suspending single pores, thereby writing lithographic patterns into the lipid. The process of local membrane manipulation was correlated to a characteristic signature in the simultaneously recorded ion current. The results show that SICM is well-suited both for contact-free imaging of soft suspended membranes and for local membrane manipulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Precise measurement of rapid volume changes of substrate-adherent cells is essential to understand many aspects of cell physiology, yet techniques to evaluate volume changes with sufficient precision and high temporal resolution are limited. Here, we describe a novel imaging method that surveys the rapid morphology modifications of living, substrate-adherent cells based on phase-contrast, digital video microscopy. Cells grown on a glass substrate are mounted in a custom-designed, side-viewing chamber and subjected to hypotonic swelling. Side-view images of the rapidly swelling cell, and at the end of the assay, an image of the same cell viewed from a perpendicular direction through the substrate, are acquired. Based on these images, off-line reconstruction of 3D cell morphology is performed, which precisely measures cell volume, height and surface at different points during cell volume changes. Volume evaluations are comparable to those obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy (DeltaVolume < or = 14\%), but our method has superior temporal resolution limited only by the time of single-image acquisition, typically approximately 100 ms. The advantages of using standard phase-contrast microscopy without the need for cell staining or intense illumination to monitor cell volume make this system a promising new tool to investigate the fundamentals of cell volume physiology.},

In immature oligodendrocyte progenitor (OLP), three distinct ionic mechanisms were involved in pH(i) regulation: (i) a sodium-independent Cl(-)/HCO(-)(3) exchanger, (ii) a Na(+)/H(+) exchanger and (iii) a voltage-dependent Na(+)-HCO(-)(3) cotransporter. The two latter mechanisms were also detected in more differentiated pro-oligodendrocytes and in mature oligodendrocytes whereas the Cl(-)/HCO(-)(3) exchanger was not active in these two later stages of differentiation. The presence of this Cl(-)/HCO(-)(3) exchanger (that acts as a chronic acidifying mechanism) only in immature OLP maintains in these cells a steady-state pH(i) value significantly lower than values measured in more differentiated cells. The possible involvement of this pH(i) change in triggering cell differentiation is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Photoswitchable fluorescent proteins have enabled new approaches for imaging cells, but their utility has been limited either because they cannot be switched repeatedly or because the wavelengths for switching and fluorescence imaging are strictly coupled. We report a bright, monomeric, reversibly photoswitchable variant of GFP, Dreiklang, whose fluorescence excitation spectrum is decoupled from that for optical switching. Reversible on-and-off switching in living cells is accomplished at illumination wavelengths of ∼365 nm and ∼405 nm, respectively, whereas fluorescence is elicited at ∼515 nm. Mass spectrometry and high-resolution crystallographic analysis of the same protein crystal in the photoswitched on- and off-states demonstrate that switching is based on a reversible hydration/dehydration reaction that modifies the chromophore. The switching properties of Dreiklang enable far-field fluorescence nanoscopy in living mammalian cells using both a coordinate-targeted and a stochastic single molecule switching approach.},

Nanoscale far-field optical resolution down to 50 nm is demonstrated by imaging microtubules in a mammalian cell and proteins on the plasma membrane of a neuron. The presence of dark states in virtually any fluorescent molecule opens up a new venue for far-field microscopy with resolution that is no longer limited by diffraction.},

  Abstract                 = {The study of development and plasticity of hippocampal circuitry would greatly benefit from methods which allow the long-term culture of neurons at low density under precisely defined culture conditions. We report that isolated hippocampal neurons from embryonic day 18 rats can be cultured for several weeks at low densities which permits the determination of individual connections. A serum-free medium was modified from the formulation of Romijn to include the biological anti-oxidants vitamin E, glutathione, pyruvate, catalase and superoxide dismutase. Neuronal survival of 80\% and neuritogenesis greatly exceeded that seen in serum-based cultures. It appeared that vitamins E, A and linolenic acid promoted neuritogenesis. The beneficial effects of the antioxidants suggested a toxic role of oxygen. To directly test this, cultures were incubated in reduced oxygen (9\%) and compared to those in the normal 19.7\% oxygen (95\% air). After 3 days in culture, neurons with processes in 9\% oxygen were more than double those in normal oxygen. Neuronal survival and neurite growth could be improved if the cells were grown on a substrate-coated surface covered with a coverslip. Under this condition, cells show a ring of growth between the center and the edge of the coverslip. In 9\% oxygen, this ring was closer to the edge of the coverslip than in normal oxygen. The coverslip did not serve as an additional substrate for attachment since it left the neurons attached to the original substrate. However, removal of the coverslip leads to cell death within 24 h, suggesting that the cells had been exposed to a toxic factor. Variations in glial cell content (less than 10\%), pH, and pCO2 were demonstrated to be unlikely explanations of the higher survival. These results suggest that growth in a diffusion-limited space, reduction of oxygen concentration to physiological levels and control of toxic oxidation with physiological antioxidants can greatly improve the survival and neuritogenesis of isolated hippocampal neurons in primary culture.},

A new role for VEGF as a neurotrophic factor has recently emerged. In the developing nervous system, VEGF plays a pivotal role not only in vascularization, but also in neuronal proliferation, and the growth of coordinated vascular and neuronal networks. After injury to the nervous system, activation of VEGF and its receptors may restore blood supply and promote neuronal survival and repair. There is a growing body of evidence that VEGF is essential for motor neurone survival, and that aberrant regulation of VEGF may play a role in the degeneration of neurones in diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

Instead, sphingolipid and cholesterol-rich membranes such as plasma membranes appear to exist, at least partially, in the liquid-ordered phase or a phase with similar properties. Sphingolipid and cholesterol-rich domains may exist as phase-separated "rafts" in the membrane. We discuss the relationship between detergent-resistant membranes, rafts, caveolae, and low-density plasma membrane fragments. We also discuss possible functions of lipid rafts in membranes. Signal transduction through the high-affinity receptor for IgE on basophils, and possibly through related receptors on other hematopoietic cells, appears to be enhanced by association with rafts. Raft association may also aid in signaling through proteins anchored by glycosylphosphatidylinositol, particularly in hematopoietic cells and neurons. Rafts may also function in sorting and trafficking through the secretory and endocytic pathways.},

Actin-rich regions of growth cones contain binding proteins that influence filament organization, such as Arp2/3, cortactin, and fascin, but little is known about the role that these proteins play in collapse. Here, we show that Semaphorin 3A (Sema 3A), which is repulsive to mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons, has unequal effects on actin binding proteins and their associated filaments. The immunofluorescence staining intensity of Arp-2 and cortactin decreases relative to total protein; whereas in unextracted growth cones fascin increases. Fascin and myosin IIB staining redistribute and show increased overlap. The degree of actin filament loss during collapse correlates with filament superstructures detected by rotary shadow electron microscopy. Collapse results in the loss of branched f-actin meshworks, while actin bundles are partially retained to varying degrees. Taken together with the known affects of Sema 3A on actin, this suggests a model for collapse that follows a sequence; depolymerization of actin meshworks followed by partial depolymerization of fascin associated actin bundles and their movement to the neurite to complete collapse. The relocated fascin associated actin bundles may provide the substrate for actomyosin contractions that produce retraction.},

Although many cues have been identified, less is known about how signals are translated into the cytoskeletal rearrangements that steer directional changes during pathfinding. Here we show that the response of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons to Semaphorin 3A gradients can be divided into two steps: growth cone collapse and retraction. Collapse is inhibited by overexpression of myosin IIA or growth on high substrate-bound laminin-1. Inhibition of collapse also prevents retractions; however collapse can occur without retraction. Inhibition of myosin II activity with blebbistatin or by using neurons from myosin IIB knockouts inhibits retraction. Collapse is associated with movement of myosin IIA from the growth cone to the neurite. Myosin IIB redistributes from a broad distribution to the rear of the growth cone and neck of the connecting neurite. High substrate-bound laminin-1 prevents or reverses these changes. This suggests a model for the Sema 3A response that involves loss of growth cone myosin IIA to facilitate actin meshwork instability and collapse, followed by myosin IIB concentration at the rear of the cone and neck region where it associates with actin bundles to drive retraction.},

The advantages of the method are 1), application of the probe to predefined regions on the membrane; 2), release of only one or a few molecules onto the cell surface; 3), when combined with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, very low background due to unbound molecules; and 4), the ability to first optimize the experiment and then repeat it on the same cell. We validated the method by performing an SMT study of the diffusion of individual membrane glycoproteins labeled with Atto 647-wheat germ agglutin in different surface domains of boar spermatozoa. We found little deviation from Brownian diffusion with a mean diffusion coefficient of 0.79 +/- 0.04 microm(2)/s in the acrosomal region and 0.10 +/- 0.02 microm(2)/s in the postacrosomal region; this difference probably reflects different membrane structures. We also showed that we can analyze diffusional properties of different subregions of the cell membrane and probe for the presence of diffusion barriers. It should be straightforward to extend this new method to other probes and cells, and it can be used as a new tool to investigate the cell membrane.},

This source is continually renewed at the tip, eliminating problems with photobleaching, and can be controlled by varying the applied potential.

  Abstract                 = {We present a new, general method for the controlled deposition of biological molecules on surfaces, based on a nanopipet operating in ionic solution. The potential applied to the pipet tip controls the flux of biological molecules from the pipet, allowing fine control of the delivery rate. We used the ion current to control the distance of the pipet from the surface of a glass slide and deposited the fluorescently labeled DNA or protein G at a defined location onto the surface. Features of 830 nm size were obtained by depositing the biotinylated DNA onto a streptavidin surface; 1.3 mum size spots were obtained by depositing protein G onto a positively charged glass surface.},

In this work, we describe the use of a novel nanofabricated gold surface, with regions of distinct topography and chemical functionalities, to solve this problem. First, nanoarrays of IgG antibodies were produced by selective immobilization in nanoholes on the surface. The smallest feature size was determined by the hole size (fwhm 90 nm) and not surface diffusion. Using holes of 300 nm diameter, we selectively addressed specific features in the array by nanopipet delivery of a functional antibody, anti-IgG. To our knowledge, this is the first example of addressing specific biologically functional features on a surface at the nanoscale.},

Key advantages of this method are that the biomolecules are always in solution and the applied voltage provides fine control of the delivery down to the single molecule level. Two consecutive cycles of deposition, to produce spatially varying features with different biological properties, were demonstrated with fluorescently labeled antibodies or biotin. This approach combines "top-down" fabrication, using the nanopen for local application, and "bottom-up" fabrication, using molecular recognition for self-assembly at defined positions, and opens up new possibilities in nanotechnology.},

  Abstract                 = {Voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) are pore-forming proteins (porins) that form the major pathway for movement of adenine nucleotides through the outer mitochondrial membrane. Electrophysiological studies indicate that VDAC-like channel activity is also prevalent in the cell membranes of many mammalian cells. However, the multitopological localization of porins outside the mitochondrion has remained an extremely controversial issue. Herein, we show that usage of two alternative first exons of the murine VDAC-1 gene leads to expression of two porins differing within their N termini. One porin (plasmalemmal VDAC-1) harboring a hydrophobic leader peptide is primarily targeted through the Golgi apparatus to the cell membrane. In contrast, the second isoform lacking the N-terminal leader (mitochondrial VDAC-1) is translocated more efficiently into the outer mitochondrial membrane. Thus, our data provide unique genetic evidence in favor of a multitopological localization of a mitochondrial porin.},

  abstract    = {Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) offers the ability to perform contact-free, high-resolution imaging of biological cells and tissues at physiological conditions. However, imaging resolution is highly dependent on the geometry of the SICM probe, which is generally not known. Small, high-resolution probes are too fine to image optically and, to date, geometry estimation has usually required electron microscopy (EM). This is time-consuming and prone to failure and cannot provide information about the crucial internal geometry of the probe. Here we demonstrate a new method for determining SICM tip geometry that overcomes the limitations of EM imaging. The method involves fitting an analytical model to current changes during quasi-controlled breakage of the pipet tip. The data can be routinely obtained using the SICM apparatus itself and our method thus opens the way for substantially better quantification in SICM imaging and measurement.},

Progenitor cell proliferation stops before birth because the cell cycle slows down, linked to an increase in differentiation and death. Experiments with transgenic mice show that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) drives progenitor cell division and suggest that slowing of and exit from the cycle reflects a decline in PDGF signaling. Overexpressing PDGF induces hyperproliferation of progenitor cells and excessive, ectopic production of oligodendrocytes. However, the superfluous oligodendrocytes die at an immature stage of differentiation, leaving a normal complement of myelin-forming cells. Therefore, cell survival controls override proliferation controls for determining the final number and distribution of mature oligodendrocytes.},

This method does not damage the sample or the cantilever and enables us to collect a lot of data in a relatively short time. Its most important feature is that data are directly organized in `force-slices', i.e. images giving immediate qualitative information on the physico-chemical structure of the sample. We present and discuss such images for two samples: a fluorescein isothyocyanate grating on silicon in air and a peroxidase grating on silicon in water, measuring the spatial variation of stiffness, attractive forces and adhesion in both cases.},

  Abstract                 = {Aquaporins (AQP) are water channel proteins that play important roles in the regulation of water homeostasis in physiological and pathological conditions. AQP4 and AQP9, the main aquaporin subtypes in the brain, are expressed in the adult forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ), where neural stem cells (NSCs) reside, but little is known about their expression and role in the NSC population, either in vivo or in vitro. Also, no reports are available on the presence of these proteins in human NSCs. We performed a detailed molecular and phenotypical characterization of different AQPs, and particularly AQP4 and AQP9, in murine and human NSC cultures at predetermined stages of differentiation. We demonstrated that AQP4 and AQP9 are expressed in adult murine SVZ-derived NSCs (ANSCs) and that their levels of expression and cellular localization are differentially regulated upon ANSC differentiation into neurons and glia. AQP4 (but not AQP9) is expressed in human NSCs and their progeny. The presence of AQP4 and AQP9 in different subsets of ANSC-derived glial cells and in different cellular compartments suggests different roles of the two proteins in these cells, indicating that ANSC-derived astrocytes might maintain in vitro the heterogeneity that characterize the astrocyte-like cell populations in the SVZ in vivo. The development of therapeutic strategies based on modulation of AQP function relies on a better knowledge of the functional role of these channels in brain cells. We provide a reliable and standardized in vitro experimental model to perform functional studies as well as toxicological and pharmacological screenings.},

Factors which influence image quality and quantitation of ion currents measured with SICM have been evaluated. Specifically, effects of probe-sample separation and pipette modulation have been systematically studied for the case of imaging conductance variations at pores in a polymer membrane under transmembrane concentration gradients. The influence of probe-sample separation on ion current images was evaluated using distance-modulated (ac) feedback. Approach curves obtained using non-modulated (dc) feedback were also recorded to determine the relative influence of pipette-generated convection by comparison of ion currents measured with both ac and dc feedback modes. To better interpret results obtained, comparison to a model based on a disk-shaped geometry for nanopores in the membrane, as well as relevant position-dependent parameters of the experiment is described. These results advance our current understanding of conductance measurements with SICM.},

  Abstract                 = {Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) was used to interrogate ion currents emanating from nanometer-scale pores of a polymer membrane. The transport activity of individual pores was measured by examining ion current images and corresponding topographic images recorded simultaneously. Localized ion currents over individual nanopores were generated by introducing a concentration difference between the upper and lower chambers of a diffusion cell. To better estimate these localized ion currents, Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) theory was used to model ion current through a permeable membrane under gradients of both concentration and applied potential. Experimental ion current profiles over a single pore fit well with theoretical plots calculated from the GHK model. On the basis of this analysis, nanoscale transport properties can be measured with SICM.},

  Abstract                 = {In the journey from the male to female reproductive tract, mammalian sperm experience a natural osmotic decrease (e.g., in mouse, from ~415 mOsm in the cauda epididymis to ~310 mOsm in the uterine cavity). Sperm have evolved to utilize this hypotonic exposure for motility activation, meanwhile efficiently silence the negative impact of hypotonic cell swelling. Previous physiological and pharmacological studies have shown that ion channel-controlled water influx/efflux is actively involved in the process of sperm volume regulation; however, no specific sperm proteins have been found responsible for this rapid osmoadaptation. Here, we report that aquaporin3 (AQP3) is a sperm water channel in mice and humans. Aqp3-deficient sperm show normal motility activation in response to hypotonicity but display increased vulnerability to hypotonic cell swelling, characterized by increased tail bending after entering uterus. The sperm defect is a result of impaired sperm volume regulation and progressive cell swelling in response to physiological hypotonic stress during male-female reproductive tract transition. Time-lapse imaging revealed that the cell volume expansion begins at cytoplasmic droplet, forcing the tail to angulate and form a hairpin-like structure due to mechanical membrane stretch. The tail deformation hampered sperm migration into oviduct, resulting in impaired fertilization and reduced male fertility. These data suggest AQP3 as an essential membrane pathway for sperm regulatory volume decrease (RVD) that balances the "trade-off" between sperm motility and cell swelling upon physiological hypotonicity, thereby optimizing postcopulatory sperm behavior.},

Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons expressed high levels of NP-1 mRNA and protein, much lower levels of KDR, and no detectable Flt-1. VEGF165 and PlGF-2 promoted DRG growth cone formation with an effect similar to that of nerve growth factor, whereas the Flt-1-specific ligand, PlGF-1, and the KDR/Flt-4 ligand, VEGF-D, had no effect. The chemorepellent NP-1 ligand, semaphorin 3A, antagonized the response to VEGF and PlGF-2. The specific KDR inhibitor, SU5614, did not affect the anti-chemorepellent effects of VEGF and PlGF-2, whereas a novel, specific antagonist of VEGF binding to NP-1, called EG3287, prevented inhibition of growth cone collapse. VEGF stimulated prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2 production in DRG cultures that was blocked by inhibitors of cyclooxygenases; the anti-chemorepellent activities of VEGF and PlGF-2 were abrogated by cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and a variety of prostacyclin analogues and prostaglandins strikingly inhibited growth cone collapse. These findings support a specific role for NP-1 in mediating neurotrophic actions of VEGF family members and also identify a novel role for prostanoids in the inhibition of neuronal chemorepulsion.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed an exposed brain preparation for observing growth cone pathfinding behavior while performing in vivo pharmacological manipulations, and we used it to test whether Xenopus retinal growth cones need filopodia to navigate. Time-lapse video observation showed that cytochalasin B acted quickly and reversibly when applied; cytochalasin B-treated growth cones lacked filopodia, but had active lamellipodia and continued to advance slowly. Whereas normal retinotectal axons visualized with horseradish peroxidase turn caudally in the mid-diencephalon to reach the tectum, cytochalasin B-treated axons grew past the normal turning point and, instead, continued straight within the diencephalon. In dose-response experiments, pathfinding became abnormal in the same concentration range in which filopodia disappeared. These results suggest that filopodia are necessary for retinal growth cones to respond to guidance signals in the diencephalon.},

  abstract = {Glass micropipette electrodes with extremely fine tips and high mechanical rigidity have been fabricated with a semi-automatic pipette-puller. The fabrication involves a two stage pull of a heated glass capillary held horizontally by a pair of non-slip clamps. Air is automatically blown from symmetrically located nozzles on to the softened portion of the capillary at the onset of the second pull. With this technique micropipettes with a relatively short taper and large cone angle at the very tip are produced, which not only possess high mechanical rigidity, but also a fineness at the tip (500 Å or less). A special advantage of the large cone angle at the tip is that such an electrode has a much lower electrical impedance than a conventional micropipette electrode with a comparable tip diameter. The size and shape of the micropipette can be easily altered to meet the specific need. The principle of differential vapour pressure has been utilized to fill the micropipettes with the desired electrolytes. A vibration technique for inserting a microelectrode into living cells is also described.},

Imaging of fluorescent proteins (FPs) using red excitation light in the 'optical window' above 600 nm is one potential method for visualizing implanted cells. However, previous efforts to engineer FPs with peak excitation beyond 600 nm have resulted in undesirable reductions in brightness. Here we report three new red-excitable monomeric FPs obtained by structure-guided mutagenesis of mNeptune. Two of these, mNeptune2 and mNeptune2.5, demonstrate improved maturation and brighter fluorescence than mNeptune, whereas the third, mCardinal, has a red-shifted excitation spectrum without reduction in brightness. We show that mCardinal can be used to non-invasively and longitudinally visualize the differentiation of myoblasts into myocytes in living mice with high anatomical detail.},

  Abstract                 = {The dye ruthenium red (RuR) has diverse experimental uses, including block of ion channels. RuR is a well described antagonist of one class of intracellular Ca2+ release channels, the ryanodine receptors, but recently this compound has also been identified as a putative blocker of voltage-gated calcium channels of the surface membrane involved in neurotransmitter release. Using electrophysiological methods, we have studied the action of RuR upon pure populations of neuronal voltage-gated ion channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. All four channel types studied, including class A (P/Q-type), class B (N-type), class C (L-type), and class E channels, are sensitive to RuR, with IC50 values ranging from 0.7 to 67.1 microM. Block of class C and class E channels most likely results from 1:1 binding of ruthenium red at a site in the extracellular entrance to the pore, resulting in obstruction of permeant ion flux through these channels. The mechanism of block of class A and class B channels is more complex, requiring binding of more than one molecule of RuR per channel.},

  Abstract                 = {During the past year, scanning probe microscopy, especially atomic force microscopy (AFM), has taken root in the biological sciences community, as is evident from the large number of publications and from the variety of specialized journals in which these papers appear. Furthermore, there is a strong indication that the technique is evolving from a qualitative imaging tool to a probe of the critical dimensions and properties of biomolecules and living cells. The next stage of the evolution involves the development of microinstruments for process control and sensing applications. Recent advances have been reported in AFM instrumentation and method. For example, the tapping mode of operation is becoming the method of choice to image biological molecules; work to extend tapping-mode operation in liquids has been reported. Biological molecules can also be imaged at low temperature in a cryo-AFM with improved resolution. The measurement of recognition forces between individual molecules continues to attract much attention and has spawned new concepts for ultra-sensitive biosensors. The AFM is being used increasingly for property measurements such as determining the viscoelastic properties of biological molecules. Finally, structural studies using the AFM abound. Some specific highlights include the mapping of DNA using restriction enzymes, imaging during DNA transcription and determining the mode of drug binding to DNA.},

  Abstract                 = {Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) has developed into a powerful tool for imaging a range of biophysical systems. In addition, SICM has been integrated with a range of other techniques, allowing for the simultaneous collection of complementary information including near-field optical and electrophysiological properties. However, SICM imaging remains insensitive to electrochemical properties, which play an important role in both biological and nonbiological systems. In this work, we demonstrate the fabrication and application of a nanopipet probe with an integrated ultramicroelectrode (UME) for concurrent SICM and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The fabrication process utilizes atomic layer deposition (ALD) of aluminum oxide to conformally insulate a gold-coated nanopipet and focused ion beam (FIB) milling to precisely expose a UME at the pipet tip. Fabricated probes are characterized by both scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry and exhibit a 100 nm diameter nanopipet tip and a UME with an effective radius of 294 nm. The probes exhibit positive and negative feedback responses on approach to conducting and insulating surfaces, respectively. The suitability of the probes for SECM-SICM imaging is demonstrated by both feedback-mode and substrate generation/tip collection-mode imaging on patterned surfaces. This probe geometry enables successful SECM-SICM imaging on features as small as 180 nm in size.},

  Abstract                 = {Spinal motoneurons develop towards postmitotic stages through early embryonic nervous system development and subsequently grow out dendrites and axons. Neuroepithelial cells of the neural tube that express Nkx6.1 are the unique precursor cells for spinal motoneurons(1). Though postmitotic motoneurons move towards their final position and organize themselves into columns along the spinal tract(2,3). More than 90\% of all these differentiated and positioned motoneurons express the transcription factors Islet 1/2. They innervate the muscles of the limbs as well as those of the body and the inner organs. Among others, motoneurons typically express the high affinity receptors for brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), the tropomyosin-related kinase B and C (TrkB, TrkC). They do not express the tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA)(4). Beside the two high affinity receptors, motoneurons do express the low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75(NTR). The p75(NTR) can bind all neurotrophins with similar but lower affinity to all neurotrophins than the high affinity receptors would bind the mature neurotrophins. Within the embryonic spinal cord, the p75(NTR) is exclusively expressed by the spinal motoneurons(5). This has been used to develop motoneuron isolation techniques to purify the cells from the vast majority of surrounding cells(6). Isolating motoneurons with the help of specific antibodies (panning) against the extracellular domains of p75(NTR) has turned out to be an expensive method as the amount of antibody used for a single experiment is high due to the size of the plate used for panning. A much more economical alternative is the use of lectin. Lectin has been shown to specifically bind to p75(NTR) as well(7). The following method describes an alternative technique using wheat germ agglutinin for a preplating procedure instead of the p75(NTR) antibody. The lectin is an extremely inexpensive alternative to the p75(NTR) antibody and the purification grades using lectin are comparable to that of the p75(NTR) antibody. Motoneurons from the embryonic spinal cord can be isolated by this method, survive and grow out neurites.},

However, similar to other therapies, inherent/acquired resistance to anti-angiogenic drugs may occur in patients, leading to disease recurrence. Recent studies in several experimental models suggest that tumor and non-tumor (stromal) cell types may be involved in the reduced responsiveness to the treatments. The present review examines the role of tumor- as well as stromal cell-derived pathways involved in tumor growth and in refractoriness to anti-VEGF therapies.},

This investigation details the implementation of a recently developed quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) method to measure the volume of erythrocytes under a range of osmotic conditions. QPM is a computational approach which utilizes simple bright field optics to generate cell phase maps which, together with knowledge of the cellular refractive index, may be used to measure cellular volume. Rat erythrocytes incubated in imidazole-buffered solutions (22 degrees C) of graded tonicity were analysed using QPM (n=10 cells/group, x63, 0.8 NA objective). Erythrocyte refractive index (1.367) was measured using a combination of phase and morphological data obtained from cells adopting spherical geometry under hypotonic conditions. Phase-computed volume increased with decreasing solution osmolality: 42.8 +/- 2.4, 48.7 +/- 2.3, 62.6 +/- 2.3, 90.8 +/- 7.7 microm3 in solutions of 540, 400, 240, and 170 mosmol/kg respectively. These volume changes were associated with crenated, bi-concave and spherical morphological states associated with increasing tonicity. This investigation demonstrates that QPM is a valid, simple and non-destructive approach for measuring cellular phase properties and volume. QPM cell volume analysis represents a significant advance in viable cell experimental capability and provides for acquisition of 'real-time' data - an option not previously available using other approaches.},

To study the role of PSA in OPP migration, we used endoneuraminidase-N, which specifically cleaves PSA from NCAM. Kinetic data showed that (i) migration velocity decreased with time and was favored on polyornithine compared to Matrigel; (ii) cells emerging from spheres enriched in PSA-NCAM+ OPP migrated farther than those from spheres enriched in GD3+ OP, their migration being enhanced by the addition of growth factors; (iii) removal of PSA from NCAM moderately reduced OPP migration and induced their differentiation in GD3+ OP and GFAP+ astrocytes; (iv) blocking integrins reduced their migration, suggesting an alternative mechanism of migration. Altogether these data illustrate that motility and differentiation of OPP involve the combinatorial action of PSA-NCAM, molecules of the ECM and their receptors, and growth factors.},

  Abstract                 = {In many CNS pathways, target innervation occurs by axon branching rather than extension of the primary growth cone into targets. To investigate mechanisms of branch formation, we studied the effects of attractive and inhibitory guidance cues on cortical axon branching. We found that netrin-1, which attracts cortical axons, and FGF-2 increased branching by >50\%, whereas semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), which repels cortical axons, inhibited branching by 50\%. Importantly, none of the factors affected axon length significantly. The increase in branching by FGF-2 and the inhibition of branching by Sema3A were mediated by opposing effects on the growth cone (expansion vs collapse) and on the cytoskeleton. FGF-2 increased actin polymerization and formation of microtubule loops in growth cones over many hours, whereas Sema3A depolymerized actin filaments, attenuated microtubule dynamics, and collapsed microtubule arrays within minutes. Netrin-1 promoted rapid axon branching, often without involving the growth cone. Branches formed de novo on the axon shaft within 30 min after local application of netrin-1, which induced rapid accumulation of actin filaments in filopodia. Importantly, increased actin polymerization and microtubule dynamics were necessary for axon branching to occur. Taken together, these results show that guidance factors influence the organization and dynamics of the cytoskeleton at the growth cone and the axon shaft to promote or inhibit axon branching. Independent of axon outgrowth, axon branching in response to guidance cues can occur over different time courses by different cellular mechanisms.},

Regulation of polymer dynamics and transport are crucial for the proper growth cone motility. This review addresses how actin filaments, microtubules, and their associated proteins play crucial roles in growth cone motility, axon outgrowth, and guidance. We present a working model for cytoskeletal regulation of directed axon outgrowth. An important goal for the future will be to understand the coordinated response of the cytoskeleton to signaling cascades induced by guidance receptor activation.},

  Abstract                 = {Axon outgrowth and guidance to the proper target requires the coordination of filamentous (F)-actin and microtubules (MTs), the dynamic cytoskeletal polymers that promote shape change and locomotion. Over the past two decades, our knowledge of the many guidance cues, receptors, and downstream signaling cascades involved in neuronal outgrowth and guidance has increased dramatically. Less is known, however, about how those cascades of information converge and direct appropriate remodeling and interaction of cytoskeletal polymers, the ultimate effectors of movement and guidance. During development, much of the communication that occurs between environmental guidance cues and the cytoskeleton takes place at the growing tip of the axon, the neuronal growth cone. Several articles on this topic focus on the "input" to the growth cone, the myriad of receptor types, and their corresponding cognate ligands. Others investigate the signaling cascades initiated by receptors and propagated by second messenger pathways (i.e., kinases, phosphatases, GTPases). Ultimately, this plethora of information converges on proteins that associate directly with the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. The role of these cytoskeletal-associated proteins, as well as the cytoskeleton itself in axon outgrowth and guidance, is the subject of this article.},

  Abstract                 = {Cortical neurons innervate many of their targets by collateral axon branching, which requires local reorganization of the cytoskeleton. We coinjected cortical neurons with fluorescently labeled tubulin and phalloidin and used fluorescence time-lapse imaging to analyze interactions between microtubules and actin filaments (F-actin) in cortical growth cones and axons undergoing branching. In growth cones and at axon branch points, splaying of looped or bundled microtubules is accompanied by focal accumulation of F-actin. Dynamic microtubules colocalize with F-actin in transition regions of growth cones and at axon branch points. In contrast, F-actin is excluded from the central region of the growth cone and the axon shaft, which contains stable microtubules. Interactions between dynamic microtubules and dynamic actin filaments involve their coordinated polymerization and depolymerization. Application of drugs that attenuate either microtubule or F-actin dynamics also inhibits polymerization of the other cytoskeletal element. Importantly, inhibition of microtubule or F-actin dynamics prevents axon branching but not axon elongation. However, these treatments do cause undirected axon outgrowth. These results suggest that interactions between dynamic microtubules and actin filaments are required for axon branching and directed axon outgrowth.},

Genetic and biochemical studies have led to the identification of highly conserved families of guidance molecules, including netrins, Slits, semaphorins, and ephrins. Guidance cues steer axons by regulating cytoskeletal dynamics in the growth cone through signaling pathways that are still only poorly understood. Elaborate regulatory mechanisms ensure that a given cue elicits the right response from the right axons at the right time but is otherwise ignored. With such regulatory mechanisms in place, a relatively small number of guidance factors can be used to generate intricate patterns of neuronal wiring.},

Less clear is their role in guiding the growth cone. Do they act permissively, providing the dynamic actin structures needed for guidance? Or do they act instructively, transducing specific guidance signals? Recent studies have provided the first strong evidence for an instructive role: extracellular guidance cues can modulate Rho GTPase activities in vitro, and Rho GTPase activators function in growth cone guidance in vivo. The pathways linking Rho GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton are also rapidly coming into view, revealing further points of regulation by extracellular guidance cues. The growth cone is therefore guided by signals transduced both via and independently of Rho GTPases.},

At first sight, the paths of migrating cells resemble those of thermally driven Brownian particles. However, cell migration is an active biological process putting a characterization in terms of normal Brownian motion into question. By analyzing the trajectories of wild-type and mutated epithelial (transformed Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells, we show experimentally that anomalous dynamics characterizes cell migration. A superdiffusive increase of the mean squared displacement, non-Gaussian spatial probability distributions, and power-law decays of the velocity autocorrelations is the basis for this interpretation. Almost all results can be explained with a fractional Klein-Kramers equation allowing the quantitative classification of cell migration by a few parameters. Thereby, it discloses the influence and relative importance of individual components of the cellular migration apparatus to the behavior of the cell as a whole.},

  Abstract                 = {Extracellular Na+ - and Cl- -concentrations ([Na+]o, [Cl-]o) were recorded with ion-selective microelectrodes during repetitive stimulation and stimulus-induced self-sustained neuronal afterdischarges (SAD) in the sensorimotor cortex of cats. In all cortical layers [Na+]o initially decreased by 4-7 mM. In depths of more than 600 micrometer below the cortical surface such decreases usually turned into increases of 2-6 mM during the course of the SADs, whereas in superficial layers [Na+]o never rose above its resting level. [Cl-]o always showed an increase in the course of the SADs often preceded by an initial small decrease. The average increase at a depth of 1,000 micrometers was about 7 mM. [Cl-]o reached peak values at about the end of the ictal period, whereas [Na+]o reached its maximum shortly after the end of the SAD, at times when [K+]o was still elevated above the baseline concentration. These data indicate that the extracellular osmolarity can increase during SAD by up to 30 mM. Such an increase in osmolarity can be explained by an increase in the number of intracellular particles, caused by cleavage of larger molecules during enhanced metabolism. This could lead to cell-swelling due to passive water influx from the extracellular space (ES). However, the resulting reduction of the size of the ES is calculated to be less than 10\% for an increase in intracellular osmolarity by 30 mOsm. This value is too small as compared to previously measured ES-reductions under similar conditions (i.e., 30\% reduction at 1,000 micrometers; Dietzel et al. 1980). Reductions of the size of the ES that accompany the observed changes in the ionic environment, are quantitatively explained on the basis of the extended glial buffering mechanism described in the preceding paper.},

After stimulus-induced extracellular [K+] elevations the delta [TMA+] and delta [Ch+] signals recorded with nominally K+-selective liquid ion-exchanger microelectrodes increased by up to 100\%, thus indicating a reduction of the ES down to one half of its initial size. The shrinkage was maximal at sites where the K+ release into the ES was also largest. At very superficial and deep layers, however, considerable increases in extracellular K+ concentration were not accompanied by significant reductions in the ES. These findings can be explained as a consequence of K+ movement through spatially extended cell structures. Calculations based on a model combining the spatial buffer mechanism of Kuffler and Nicholls (1966) to osmolarity changes caused by selective K+ transport through primarily K+ permeable membranes support this concept. Following stimulation additional iontophoretically induced [K+]0 rises were reduced in amplitude by up to 35\%, even at sites where maximal decreases of the ES were observed. This emphasizes the importance of active uptake for K+ clearance out of the ES.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this investigation is to estimate the contribution of spatial glial K+ buffer currents to extracellular K+ homeostasis during enhanced neuronal activity. Neuronal hyperactivity was induced by electrical stimulation of the cortical surface or the ventrobasal thalamic nuclei of cats (5-50 Hz, 0.1-0.2 ms, two to three times threshold stimulation intensity, 5-20 s). The accompanying slow field potential changes were recorded simultaneously across the grey matter with vertical assemblies of eight micropipettes glued 300 microns apart. Using the Poisson equation, the amplitudes of the underlying current sources and sinks were calculated. The current source densities depended on the depth of recording, frequency, strength, and duration of the stimulation. Current sinks, corresponding to a removal of 0.1-0.5 mmoles of monovalent cations per liter of brain tissue and second from the extracellular space, were observed in middle cortical layers, whereas sources appeared at superficial and deeper sites. These sinks and sources might represent K+ moved across glial membranes by spatial buffer currents. The consequences of glial buffer currents of this magnitude were investigated with model calculations. It turned out that measurements of electrolyte and volume changes of the extracellular space (Dietzel et al. Exp. Brain Res. 40:432-439, 1980; Exp. Brain Res. 46:73-84, 1982) could only partially be explained by spatial buffer currents of this magnitude. Comparison of the calculated values with intracellular measurements in neurons and glial cells (Coles et al. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 481:303-317, 1986; Ballanyi et al. J. Physiol. 382:159-174, 1987) suggests that spatial buffering combines with an approximately equimolar KCl transport and, depending on the preparation, also K+/Na+-exchange across glial membranes.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been reported that store-mediated Ca2+ entry (SMCE) in human platelets is likely to be mediated by a secretion-like coupling mechanism. Recently, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) has been used in the investigation of SMCE. Here, the mechanism of action of 2-APB is investigated in human platelets. In a Ca2+-free medium (EGTA added), addition of 0.1 U/ml thrombin caused an elevation in [Ca2+]i. Preincubation with 100 microM 2-APB for 170s abolished the release of internal Ca2+. In platelets whose internal Ca2+ stores had been depleted by treatment with 200 nM thapsigargin, addition of extracellular Ca2+ caused an elevation in [Ca2+]i indicative of SMCE. Preincubation with 2-APB decreased SMCE by 95.5+/-1.1\%. After activation of SMCE, addition of 2-APB rapidly decreased [Ca2+]i to basal levels; in contrast, the coupling between Trp1 and IP3RII, which has been shown to play an important role in SMCE in platelets, remained intact at the same time points. The rate of decrease of [Ca2+]i and the absence of measurable latency in the effect of 2-APB were comparable to the effects of La3+ (a cation channel blocker). These data suggest that 2-APB may act as a blocker of Ca2+ permeable plasma membrane channels. These data provide further information regarding the mechanism and site of action of 2-APB and highlight the necessity of careful interpretation of work performed using this molecule.},

  Abstract                 = {The coordination of protrusion with retraction is essential for continuous cell movement. In fish keratocytes the activation of stretch-activated calcium channels, and the resulting increase in intracellular calcium, trigger release of the rear cell margin when forward movement is impeded. Although it is likely that retraction involves a calcium-dependent increase in cytoskeletal contractility, it is not known how the timing, magnitude and localization of contractile forces are organized during retraction. We have addressed this question using a new gelatin traction force assay in combination with calcium imaging to determine what changes in cytoskeletal force production accompany calcium-induced retraction. We find that individual calcium transients are followed within seconds by a rapid increase in traction stress that is maintained, or increases in a stepwise manner, until retraction occurs. Increases in traction stress are accompanied by a distinct sequence of changes in the spatial distribution of large traction stresses. Regions of increased traction stress enlarge at the lateral cell margins and expand forward along the cell margin. In particular, rearward facing propulsive' tractions at the leading edge of the cell, which are normally very low, increase several fold. Following retraction, a precipitous drop in traction stress is observed. Such distinct variations in traction stress are not observed in cells when calcium transients are absent. These results suggest a mechanism by which global increases in intracellular calcium can locally regulate contractile force production, in order to maintain a rapid highly directed mode of movement.},

  Abstract                 = {The activation of stretch-activated calcium channels (SACs) in keratocytes can induce spatially coordinated increases in traction stress that promote protrusion at the cell front, while simultaneously inducing retraction at the rear. To investigate how this occurs, we correlated calcium-induced changes in traction stress with alterations in cell speed and shape. Cyclic changes in these parameters were associated with each calcium transient. In addition, an inverse relationship was found between traction stress and cell speed, suggesting that alternating changes in adhesiveness were occurring at the rear. We investigated this further by inhibiting or inducing calcium transients and observing the effects on traction stress, cell speed and shape. Inhibition of calcium transients prevented retraction and led to a slow increase in traction stress. In addition, large aggregates of vinculin developed at the lateral rear edges of treated keratocytes, consistent with an increase in adhesiveness. Induction of a calcium transient resulted in a rapid retraction, involving both increased traction stress and adhesion disassembly at the rear. We also found that keratocytes exhibiting frequent transients generated larger traction stress and moved significantly faster than other cells. Together, these data suggest that calcium transients coordinate changes in adhesiveness with SAC-mediated cycles of mechano-chemical feedback.},

  Abstract                 = {To maintain the intracellular concentration of ions and small molecules on osmotic challenges, nature has developed highly sophisticated transport systems for regulating water and ion content. An ideal measurement technique for volume changes of cells during osmotic challenges has to fulfil two requirements: it has to be osmotically inert, and it should allow online monitoring of cell volume changes. Here, a simple fluorescence microscopy-based approach is presented. Using fluorescein as a negative stain, it is possible to monitor cell volume changes without affecting the functionality of cell membranes and cell osmolarity. Measurement of Madine-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells after hypo- and hyperosmotic challenges reveals the main advantages of this approach: besides providing precise and reproducible quantitative data on reversible cell volume changes, the viability of the cells can be assessed directly by the appearance of stain in the cytoplasm. This becomes evident especially after hypo-osmotic challenge of glutaraldehyde-treated cells, which become leaky after fixation, followed by a massive volume change. This new approach represents a very sensitive measurement technique for cell volume changes resulting from water or ion flux, and thus seems to be an ideal tool for studying cell volume regulatory processes.},

However, recent immunochemical studies suggest the presence of TTX-sensitive neuronal-type VDSC in the heart. Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) coupled to electrophysiology was used to obtain more direct functional evidence. TTX sensitivities of whole-cell sodium currents (I(Na)) in control and detubulated cells were compared. Addition of 200 nM TTX decreased I(Na) of control cells by 20\%, whereas detubulated cells were hardly effected. The remaining current peaked slightly earlier and inactivation decay was faster (as in neuronal VDSC) than in detubulated cells. Single-channel activity was first assayed at random on the plasmalemma, and after topography had been revealed by SICM, at patched T-tubules openings. In the latter case, a single-channel conductance of 11-12pS was observed with a higher rate of success. This study provides independent evidence for neuronal VDSC in cardiomyocytes where they could rapidly and synchronously couple T-tubule and cell surface depolarizations.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial distribution of maxi-anion channels in rat cardiomyocytes were studied by applying the recently developed patch clamp technique under scanning ion conductance microscopy, called the "smart-patch" technique. In primary-cultured neonatal cells, the channel was found to be unevenly distributed over the cell surface with significantly lower channel activity in cellular extensions compared with the other parts. Local ATP release, detected using a PC12 cell-based biosensor technique, also exhibited a similar pattern. The maxi-anion channel activity could not be detected in freshly isolated adult cardiomyocytes by the conventional patch-clamp with 2-MOmega pipettes. However, when fine-tipped 15-20 MOmega pipettes were targeted to only Z-line areas, we observed, for the first time, the maxi-anion events. Smart-patching different regions of the cell surface, we found that the channel activity was maximal at the openings of T-tubules and along Z-lines, but was significantly decreased in the scallop crest area. Thus, it is concluded that maxi-anion channels are concentrated at the openings of T-tubules and along Z-lines in adult cardiomyocytes. This study showed that the smart-patch technique provides a powerful method to detect a unitary event of channels that are localized at some specific site in the narrow region.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe highly localized electrochemical measurements and imaging using a simple, mobile theta pipet cell. Each channel (diameter <500 nm) of a tapered theta pipet is filled with electrolyte solution and a Ag/AgCl electrode, between which a bias is applied, resulting in a conductance current across a thin meniscus of solution at the end of the pipet, which is typically deployed in air or a controlled gaseous environment. When the position of the pipet normal to a surface of interest is oscillated, an oscillating component in the conductance current is generated when the meniscus at the end of the probe comes into contact with the surface and undergoes periodic (reversible) deformation, so as to modulate the solution resistance. This oscillating current component can be used to maintain gentle contact of the solution from the pipet cell with the surface and as a set point for high resolution topographical imaging with the pipet. Simultaneously, the mean conductance current that flows between the pipet channels can be measured and is sensitive to the local nature of the interface, informing one, for example, on wettability and ion flow into or out of the surface investigated. Furthermore, conductor or semiconductor surfaces can be connected as a working electrode, with one of the electrodes in the pipet serving as a quasi-reference electrode. This pipet cell then constitutes part of a dynamic electrochemical cell, with which direct voltammetric-amperometric imaging can be carried out simultaneously with conductance and topographical imaging. This provides multifunctional electrochemical maps of surfaces and interfaces at high spatial resolution. The prospects for the use of this new methodology widely are highlighted through exemplar studies and a brief discussion of future applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Methodology was developed to measure osmotic water permeability in monolayer cultured cells and applied to examine the proposed role of glucose transporters in the water pathway (1989. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 86:8397-8401). J774 macrophages were grown on glass coverslips and mounted in a channel-type perfusion chamber for rapid fluid exchange without cell detachment. Relative cell volume was measured by 45 degrees light scattering using an inverted microscope; measurement accuracy was validated by confocal imaging microscopy. The time required for greater than 90\% fluid exchange was less than 1 s. In response to a decrease in perfusate osmolality from 300 to 210 mosM, cells swelled without lag at an initial rate of 4.5\%/s, corresponding to a water permeability coefficient of (6.3 +/- 0.4) x 10(-3) cm/s (SE, n = 20, 23 degrees C), assuming a cell surface-to-volume ratio of 4,400 cm-1. The initial rate of cell swelling was proportional to osmotic gradient size, independent of perfusate viscosity, and increased by amphotericin B (25 micrograms/ml), and had an activation energy of 10.0 +/- 1 kcal/mol (12-39 degrees C). The compounds phloretin (20 microM) and cytochalasin B (2.5 micrograms/ml) inhibited glucose transport by greater than 85\% but did not influence Pf in paired experiments in which Pf was measured before and after inhibitor addition. The mercurials HgCl2 (0.1 mM) and p-chloromercuribenzoate (1 mM) did not inhibit Pf. A stopped-flow light scattering technique was used to measure Pf independently in J774 macrophages grown in suspension culture. Pf in suspended cells was (4.4 +/- 0.3) x 10(-3) cm/s (assuming a surface-to-volume ratio of 8,800 cm-1), increased more than threefold by amphotericin B, and not inhibited by phloretin and cytochalasin B under conditions of strong inhibition of glucose transport. The glucose reflection coefficient was 0.98 +/- 0.03 as measured by induced osmosis, assuming a unity reflection coefficient for sucrose. These results establish a quantitative method for measurement of osmotic water transport in adherent cultured cells and provide evidence that glucose transporters are not involved in the water transporting pathway.},

  Abstract                 = {Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) is a scanned probe microscopy technique in which the probe is a fine glass pipet filled with a contact (reference) electrode and an electrolyte solution. The current flow between the reference electrode and a second reference electrode positioned in bulk solution when the two electrodes are biased externally can be used as a feedback signal to maintain a constant separation between the tip and a surface during imaging. In usual practice the tip position is modulated over a small amplitude perpendicular to the surface, and the resulting alternating current (AC) is used as the feedback signal, although the direct current can also be used. A comprehensive model for the current response is reported. Laplace's equation has been solved for the electrolyte solution for a range of tip geometries, enabling the factors controlling the tip current to be identified. The approach developed is shown to represent an improvement over earlier semiempirical treatments. To explore the influence of surface topography on the (AC) current response, various surfaces have been considered, including a tip moved toward a planar surface (in the normal direction) and tips scanned over a pit and a step in the surface. The results have allowed a critical assessment of the SICM response as a means of probing surface topography. Features identified through simulation have been found in experiments through studies of two model substrates for which imaging results are reported. In typical experimental practice, the response of the SICM tip to surface features occurs over much greater lateral distances than the size of the pipet aperture.},

  Abstract                 = {Extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules have been shown to function as cues for neurite guidance in various populations of neurons. Here we show that laminin (LN) and fibronectin (FN) presented in stripe micro-patterns can provide guidance cues to neonatal (P5) inner ear spiral ganglion (SG) neurites. The response to both ECM molecules was dose-dependent. In a LN versus poly-L-lysine (PLL) assay, neurites were more often observed on PLL at low coating concentrations (5 and 10 microg/mL), while they were more often on LN at a high concentration (80 microg/mL). In a FN versus PLL assay, neurites were more often on PLL than on FN stripes at high coating concentrations (40 and 80 microg/mL). In a direct competition between LN and FN, neurites were observed on LN significantly more often than on FN at both 10 and 40 microg/mL. The data suggest a preference by SG neurites for LN at high concentrations, as well as avoidance of both LN at low and FN at high concentrations. The results also support a potential model for neurite guidance in the developing inner ear in vivo. LN, in the SG and osseus spiral lamina may promote SG dendrite growth toward the organ of Corti. Within the organ of Corti, lower concentrations of LN may slow neurite growth, with FN beneath each row of hair cells providing a stop or avoidance signal. This could allow growth cone filopodia increased time to sample their cellular targets, or direct the fibers upward toward the hair cells.},

The activity of Ca(2+) channels coordinate these steps by arranging intracellular Ca(2+) signals along the axis of movement. Here, we investigated the role of the putative mechanosensitive canonical transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1) in cell migration. We analyzed its function in transformed renal epithelial (Madin-Darby canine kidney-focus) cells with variation of TRPC1 expression. As shown by time lapse video microscopy, TRPC1 knockdown cells have partially lost their polarity and the ability to persistently migrate into a given direction. This failure is linked to the suppression of a local Ca(2+) gradient at the front of migrating TRPC1 knockdown cells, whereas TRPC1 overexpression leads to steeper Ca(2+) gradients. We propose that the Ca(2+) signaling events regulated by TRPC1 within the lamellipodium determine polarity and directed cell migration.},

  Abstract                 = {A method was developed to measure the osmotic water permeability (Pf) of plasma membranes in cell layers and applied to cells and epithelia expressing molecular water channels. It was found that the integrated intensity of monochromatic light in a phase contrast or dark field microscope was dependent on relative cell volume. For cells of different size and shape (Sf9, MDCK, CHO, A549, tracheal epithelia, BHK), increased cell volume was associated with decreased signal intensity; generally the signal decreased 10-20\% for a twofold increase in cell volume. A theory relating signal intensity to relative cell volume was developed based on spatial filtering and changes in optical path length associated with cell volume changes. Theory predictions were confirmed by signal measurements of cell layers bathed in solutions of various osmolarities and refractive indices. The excellent signal-to-noise ratio of the transmitted light detection permitted measurement of cell volume changes of <1\%. The method was applied to characterize transfected cells and tissues that natively express water channels. Pf in control Chinese hamster ovary cells was low (0.0012 cm/s at 23 degrees C) and increased more than fourfold upon stable transfection with aquaporins 1, 2, 4, or 5. Pf in apical and basolateral membranes in polarized epithelial cells grown on porous supports was measured. Pfbl and Pfap were 0.0011 and 0.0024 cm/s (MDCK cells), and 0.0039 and 0.0052 cm/s (human tracheal cells) at 23 degrees C. In intact toad urinary bladder, basolateral Pf was 0.036 cm/s and apical membrane Pf after vasopressin stimulation was 0.025 cm/s at 23 degrees C. The results establish light microscopy with spatial filtering as a technically simple and quantitative method to measure water permeability in cell layers and provide the first measurement of the apical and basolateral membrane permeabilities of several important epithelial cell types.},

Current research is focused on further improving spatial resolution in an effort to reach the goal of video-rate imaging of live cells with molecular (1-5 nm) resolution. Here, we describe the contributions of fluorescent probes to far-field super-resolution imaging, focusing on fluorescent proteins and organic small-molecule fluorophores.

So far the lack of predictive biomarkers has precluded identification of patients most likely to respond to such treatments. Recent suggest that both tumor and non-tumor (stromal) cell types are involved in the reduced responsiveness to the treatments. The present review examines the role of tumor- as well as stromal cell-derived pathways involved in tumor growth and in refractoriness to anti-VEGF therapies.},

  Abstract                 = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen in vitro and an angiogenic inducer in a variety of in vivo models. Hypoxia has been shown to be a major inducer of VEGF gene transcription. The tyrosine kinases Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and Flk-1/KDR (VEGFR-2) are high-affinity VEGF receptors. The role of VEGF in developmental angiogenesis is emphasized by the finding that loss of a single VEGF allele results in defective vascularization and early embryonic lethality. VEGF is critical also for reproductive and bone angiogenesis. Substantial evidence also implicates VEGF as a mediator of pathological angiogenesis. In situ hybridization studies demonstrate expression of VEGF mRNA in the majority of human tumors. Anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies and other VEGF inhibitors block the growth of several tumor cell lines in nude mice. Clinical trials with various VEGF inhibitors in a variety of malignancies are ongoing. Very recently, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (bevacizumab; Avastin) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with chemotherapy. Furthermore, VEGF is implicated in intraocular neovascularization associated with diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration.},

  Abstract                 = {Axonal outgrowth is of paramount significance for establishing the intricate neuronal network both during embryogenesis and nerve regeneration. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is known for its essential role in vascular sprouting and its involvement in cancer, has recently been found to exert a trophic activity on neurons leading to an increased axonal outgrowth. Although two receptors, VEGFR-2 and neuropilin-1, were identified on neurons, the signaling pathways associated with them are not well understood. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of VEGF on the growth cone morphology and motility of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. Moreover, we aimed for a deeper understanding of VEGFR-2 on growth cones that potentially mediates the stimulating and attractive effects. We cultivated chicken DRG in medium containing mouse VEGF and analyzed growth cone size. The data presented here show a positive effect of VEGF on growth cone size. Furthermore, we interrupted the activity of VEGFR-2 by either blocking the tyrosine residue 1214 (tyr1214) or by inhibiting the receptor phosphorylation with axitinib, a novel small molecule, which has recently entered phase III trials for cancer treatment. Disruption of the VEGFR-2 leads to a significantly diminished growth cone size. Based on these findings, we propose a positive effect of VEGF on peripheral nervous system growth cone size and show for the first time quantitative data to underline this hypothesis. Additionally, we propose that VEGFR-2 and especially the tyr1214-dependent pathway of VEGFR-2 are of importance in VEGF signaling in the growth cone of DRG neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic peptide that is produced in the brain after ischemia, injury or in malignant gliomas. Since these pathological conditions are associated with the infiltration of microglial cells, we investigated the expression of VEGF receptors (VEGFR) and possible effects of VEGF on cultivated microglial cells. As shown by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry, rat microglial cells as well as the murine cell line BV-2 express the VEGFR-1, but not VEGFR-2. Murine VEGF induced 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA of murine and rat microglial cells as well as chemotaxis in Boyden chamber assays. However, VEGF did not alter the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and only slightly that of the kinase Akt. These results show that microglial cells are targets for VEGF which induces migration and proliferation of these immunocompetent cells in the brain.},

  Abstract                 = {Neuropilin-1 (NP-1) was first identified as a semaphorin receptor involved in neuron guidance. Subsequent studies demonstrated that NP-1 also binds an isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as well as several VEGF homologs, suggesting that NP-1 may also function in angiogenesis. Here we report in vitro binding experiments that shed light on the interaction between VEGF165 and NP-1, as well as a previously unknown interaction between NP-1 and one of the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR1 or Flt-1. BIAcore analysis demonstrated that, with the extracellular domain (ECD) of NP-1 immobilized at low density, VEGF165 bound with low affinity (K(d) = 2 microm) and fast kinetics. The interaction was dependent on the heparin-binding domain of VEGF165 and increased the affinity of VEGF165 for its signaling receptor VEGFR2 or kinase insert domain-containing receptor. The affinity of VEGF165 for the NP-1 ECD was greatly enhanced either by increasing the density of immobilized NP-1 (K(d) = 113 nm) or by the addition of heparin (K(d) = 25 nm). We attribute these affinity enhancements to avidity effects mediated by the bivalent VEGF165 homodimer or multivalent heparin. We also show that the NP-1 ECD binds with high affinity (K(d) = 1.8 nm) to domains 3 and 4 of Flt-1 and that this interaction inhibits the binding of NP-1 to VEGF165. Based on these results, we propose that NP-1 acts as a coreceptor for various ligands and that these functions are dependent on the density of NP-1 on the cell membrane. Furthermore, Flt-1 may function as a negative regulator of angiogenesis by competing for NP-1.},

  Abstract                 = {Oligodendroglial proteins labeled with radioactive amino acids were subjected to one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Bands comigrating with myelin proteins, the basic protein (MBP), the proteolipid protein (PLP), and the Wolfgram protein (WP) doublet, were detected by Coomassie Blue staining and by autoradiography. The identity of the MBP and WP in the cellular material is evidenced by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. A comparative study of myelin samples from rat and pig CNS reveals that WP can be detected immunochemically in both species. Different protein patterns, however, are observed. Three protein bands are found with antibodies against the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). The high-molecular-weight component prevails in pig myelin, whereas the medium-molecular-weight component is predominant in rat myelin. Moreover, two protein bands, of molecular weights 35,000 and 33,000 (Ol 1 and Ol 2), are present in high amounts in oligodendroglial particulate material but are not detectable in myelin. These oligodendroglial characteristic proteins are not species-specific, since they are found in preparations of cat oligodendrocytes as well. Activities of cerebroside sulfotransferase (EC 2.8.2.11) are low in freshly isolated cells and increase during the first week of culture. A reverse course of enzyme activities is observed with 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.4.37). Values reach a minimum about day 5 in culture and recover their initial values. At day 10 they remain stable until the end of the third week of the culture period.},

  Abstract                 = {A method is described by which oligodendrocytes from adult pig brains can be isolated. It results in a cellular preparation suitable for long-term culture. The entire procedure can be accomplished within 2-3 h. The purity of oligodendrocytes ranges between 80 and 95\% depending on the Percoll gradient used and on the time in vitro. Yields between 2.5 and 4 X 10(7) cells per brain and plating efficiencies on the order of 60\% make the system very useful for biochemical investigations. It was shown by immunocytochemical studies that oligodendrocytes produce extensive networks of processes, some of them having elaborate membranous expansions. Anti-galactocerebroside (GC) antibodies as well as anti-myelin basic protein (MBP), anti-Wolfgram protein (WP), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and monoclonal antibodies O1 and O4 are used to identify the cell types and to characterize the cellular composition of the cultures. Anti-GC and O1 are suitable markers for these oligodendrocytes. Both antibodies label similar cells, and the staining intensities are equally strong. In the case of O4, variable staining intensities are observed, and a few additional cells are labeled that are anti-GC-. After 3 1/2 weeks in culture, about 60\% of the cells can be labeled by anti-MBP. Here too differences in staining intensities are observed. The anti-WP stain is too weak to be defined as positive. The percentage of GFAP+ cells lies in the range 15-20\% at maximum. Cells were also mixed into collagen gels. This method appears to be more useful for outgrowth and branching of fibers than are monolayer systems. Drawbacks, however, include limited access for the antibodies and poor recovery of undamaged cells with their fibers.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method, conductance scanning, allows determination of local para- and transcellular conductivities in flat epithelia. Experiments were performed on kidney distal tubule cells, MDCK clone C11, which form monolayers on permeable supports. Above the apical surface, local voltage drops generated by a sinusoidal current clamp were recorded by means of a scanning microelectrode. Data were collected above cell centres and tight junctions. The scanning signal was always significantly higher above the tight junctions, but was uniformly distributed along the junctions. For determination of conductivities two procedures were applied. Method 1: the supraepithelial potential distribution was computed for given trans- and paracellular currents at all positions of the electrode. In a fit algorithm, the currents were varied until the calculated potential difference equalled the voltage measured. Method 2: after collecting scanning data in control Ringer's, intercellular space width was reduced by mucosal addition of 40 mM sucrose and a second set of data was obtained at decreased paracellular, but presumably unchanged transcellular, conductivity. From these data, trans- and paracellular conductivities were calculated. Results of both methods were in excellent agreement. Confluent MDCK-C11 monolayers exhibited a transepithelial conductivity of 13 mS/cm2. The transcellular pathway contributed 2.6 mS/cm2 (20\%) and the paracellular pathway 10. 5 mS/cm2 (80\%) to the total conductivity. Collapse of the lateral intercellular spaces decreased the paracellular conductivity to 4 mS/cm2 (60\%). Confluent MDCK-C11 monolayers constitute true "leaky" epithelia with homogeneously distributed trans- and paracellular conductivities. In conclusion, conductance scanning fills a methodical gap, which hitherto impeded the functional characterization of tight junctions.},

  Abstract                 = {The regenerative growth in culture of the axons of two giant identified neurons from the central nervous system of Aplysia californica was observed using video-enhanced contrast-differential interference contrast microscopy. This technique allowed the visualization in living cells of the membranous organelles of the growth cone. Elongation of axonal branches always occurred through the same sequence of events: A flat organelle-free veil protruded from the front of the growth cone, gradually filled with vesicles that entered by fast axonal transport and Brownian motion from the main body of the growth cone, became more voluminous and engorged with organelles (vesicles, mitochondria, and one or two large, irregular, refractile bodies), and, finally, assumed the cylindrical shape of the axon branch with the organelles predominantly moving by bidirectional fast axonal transport. The veil is thus the nascent axon. Because veils appear to be initially free of membranous organelles, addition of membrane to the plasmalemma by exocytosis is likely to occur in the main body of the growth cone rather than at the leading edge. Veils almost always formed with filopodial borders, protruding between either fully extended or growing filopodia. Therefore, one function of the filopodia is to direct elongation by demarcating the pathway along which axolemma flows. Models of axon growth in which the body of the growth cone is pulled forward, or in which advance of the leading edge is achieved by filopodial shortening or contraction against an adhesion to the substrate, are inconsistent with our observations. We suggest that, during the elongation phase of growth, filopodia may act as structural supports.},

  Abstract                 = {The most valuable property of stem cells (SCs) is their potential to differentiate into many or all cell types of the body. So far, monitoring SC differentiation has only been possible after cells were fixed or destroyed during sample preparation. It is, however, important to develop nondestructive methods of monitoring SCs. Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) is a unique imaging technique that uses similar principles to the atomic force microscope, but with a pipette for the probe. This allows scanning of the surface of living cells noninvasively and enables measurement of cellular activities under more physiological conditions than is possible with other high-resolution microscopy techniques. We report here the novel use of the SICM for studying SCs to assess and monitor the status of SCs and various cell types differentiated from SCs.},

The scanning patch-clamp technique combines scanning ion conductance microscopy and patch-clamp recording through a single glass nanopipette probe. In this method the nanopipette is first scanned over a cell surface, using current feedback, to obtain a high-resolution topographic image. This same pipette is then used to make the patch-clamp recording. Because image information is obtained via the patch electrode it can be used to position the pipette onto a cell with nanometer precision. The utility of this technique is demonstrated by obtaining ion channel recordings from the top of epithelial microvilli and openings of cardiomyocyte T-tubules. Furthermore, for the first time we have demonstrated that it is possible to record ion channels from very small cells, such as sperm cells, under physiological conditions as well as record from cellular microstructures such as submicron neuronal processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Obstetric cholestasis is characterized by raised bile acids, and can be complicated by intrauterine death. We have shown that the bile acid taurocholate causes loss of synchronous beating, bradycardia and cessation of contraction in cultured rat cardiomyocytes [Williamson, Gorelik, Eaton, Lab, de Swiet and Korchev (2001) Clin. Sci. 100, 363-369]. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of taurocholate on cardiomyocytes further. We demonstrated a reduced rate of contraction and proportion of beating cells when rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to increasing concentrations of taurocholate (0.1-3.0 mM); more marked at higher concentrations (P<0.001). Using scanning ion-conductance microscopy, we also demonstrated reduced amplitude of contraction and calcium transients with taurocholate. Our observations indicate that taurocholate affects calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and this parallels changes in contractile function. The relationship between the contraction amplitude and calcium transient is not linear, particularly at higher concentrations of taurocholate. We observed different effects in individual cultured neonatal cells; a reversible reduction in rate and amplitude of contraction in some, and irreversible oscillatory (fibrillatory) cessation of beating in others. The effects were more marked with higher concentrations. The contraction amplitude was also reduced in adult cardiomyocytes. The changes were reversible following removal of taurocholate in adult, but not in neonatal, cardiomyocytes exposed to higher concentrations (>0.3 mM) (P<0.001). In conclusion we have demonstrated that the bile acid taurocholate can cause different types of dysrhythmia in individual cardiomyocytes. These results provide further support for the hypothesis that obstetric cholestasis may produce cardiac-related sudden intrauterine death.},

We demonstrated that taurocholate had a more marked effect on all of these parameters, and the effects of the glycoconjugates were fully reversible while those of tauroconjugates were not.

Although dexamethasone had no immediate protective effect on these changes, pre-incubation with dexamethasone was protective.

  Abstract                 = {Although the dynamics of cell membranes and associated structures is vital for cell function, little is known due to lack of suitable methods. We found, using scanning ion conductance microscopy, that microvilli, membrane projections supported by internal actin bundles, undergo a life cycle: fast height-dependent growth, relatively short steady state, and slow height-independent retraction. The microvilli can aggregate into relatively stable structures where the steady state is extended. We suggest that the intrinsic dynamics of microvilli, combined with their ability to make stable structures, allows them to act as elementary "building blocks" for the assembly of specialized structures on the cell surface.},

  Abstract                 = {Cardiac toxicity is an uncommon but potentially serious complication of cancer therapy, especially with anthracyclines. One of the most effective anticancer drugs is doxorubicin, but its value is limited by the risk of developing cardiomyopathy and ventricular arrhythmia. When applied to a network of periodically contracting cardiomyocytes in culture, doxorubicin induces rhythm disturbances. Using a novel rapid assay based on non-invasive ion-conductance microscopy we show that the beta-antagonist esmolol can restore rhythm in doxorubicin-treated cultures of cardiomyocytes. Moreover, esmolol pre-treatment can protect the culture from doxorubicin-induced arrhythmia.},

  Abstract                 = {The role of t-tubule structures in excitation-contraction coupling of ventricular myocytes has been investigated by disruption using prolonged culture, or osmotic shock with formamide. We have used a new method, the Scanning Ion Conductance Microscope (SICM), to investigate in more detail the changes in surface structure of live myocytes during these interventions and to relate them to contractile effects.Freshly isolated ventricular myocytes from adult rat hearts were either incubated with formamide, then washed to produce osmotic shock, or put into culture for 2, 4 and 7 days. Contractile characteristics of single myocytes were then measured using the IonOptix system, and in parallel imaged using the SICM which produces a 3-dimensional topographical representation of the cell surface. Loss of t-tubules was quantitated with confocal microscopy after staining with the membrane dye di-8-ANNEPS, and sarcomere structure revealed by immunocytochemical detection of alpha-actinin.Detubulation was produced by either method, with formamide equivalent to 4 day culture in quantitative measures of ANNEPS t-tubule/membrane ratio. SICM images confirmed the loss of t-tubule indentations. Disruption of the Z-groove structure and flattening of the surface were also noted with formamide and, to a lesser extent, culture. A novel Z-groove index was introduced to describe this effect more quantitatively. Contraction and relaxation were impaired by the detubulation methods, but formamide had a markedly greater depressant effect on contraction amplitude than equivalent detubulation by culture.Changes in contraction amplitude after detubulation with formamide were more closely related to the alteration in Z-groove structure than loss of t-tubules alone. As well as disrupting t-tubule-induced excitation and calcium movements, formamide may alter the transmission of contraction in the myocyte by interference with sarcomere attachment at the Z-line.},

  Abstract                 = {Aldosterone, the most important sodium-retaining hormone, was first characterized >50 years ago. However, despite numerous studies including the classical work of Isidore S. "Izzy" Edelman showing that aldosterone action depended on ATP production, the mechanism by which it activates sodium reabsorption via the epithelial sodium channel remains unclear. Here, we report experiments that suggest that one of the key steps in aldosterone action is via an autocrine/paracrine system. The hormone stimulates ATP release from the basolateral side of the target kidney cell. Prevention of ATP accumulation or its removal blocks aldosterone action. ATP then acts via a purinergic mechanism to produce contraction of small groups of adjacent epithelial cells. Patch clamping demonstrates that it is these contracted cells that have channel activity. With progressive recruitment of contracting cells, there is then a parallel increase in transepithelial electrical conductance. In common with other stimuli of sodium transport, this pathway involves phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase blocks both cell contraction and conductance. We put forward the hypothesis that redistribution of the cell volume caused by the lateral contraction results in apical swelling and that this change, in turn, disrupts the epithelial sodium channel interaction with the F-actin cytoskeleton, opening the channel and hence increasing sodium transport.},

  Abstract                 = {Continuous high spatial resolution observations of living A6 cells would greatly aid the elucidation of the relationship between structure and function and facilitate the study of major physiological processes such as the mechanism of action of aldosterone. Unfortunately, observing the micro-structural and functional changes in the membrane of living cells is still a formidable challenge for a microscopist.Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM), which uses a glass nanopipette as a sensitive probe, has been shown to be suitable for imaging non-conducting surfaces bathed in electrolytes. A specialized version of this microscopy has been developed by our group and has been applied to image live cells at high-resolution for the first time. This method can also be used in conjunction with patch clamping to study both anatomy and function and identify ion channels in single cells.This new microscopy provides high-resolution images of living renal cells which are comparable with those obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Continuous 24h observations under normal physiological conditions showed how A6 kidney epithelial cells changed their height, volume, and reshaped their borders. The changes in cell area correlated with the density of microvilli on the surface. Surface microvilli density ranged from 0.5 microm(-2) for extended cells to 2.5 microm(2) for shrunk cells. Patch clamping of individual cells enabled anatomy and function to be correlated.Scanning ion conductance microscopy provides unique information about living cells that helps to understand cellular function. It has the potential to become a powerful tool for research on living renal cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Na+/H+ exchange (antiport) is a major pathway for the regulation of intracellular pH. Antiport activity is stimulated when suspended cells adhere to the substratum. In this report, immunofluorescence was used to study the subcellular localization of the ubiquitous NHE-1 isoform of the antiport. NHE-1 was not distributed homogeneously on the surface of the cells. Instead, antiports were found to accumulate along the border of lamellipodia and near the edge of finer processes. Dual immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated that vinculin, talin and F-actin are concentrated at sites of NHE-1 accumulation. A mutated construct of NHE-1 lacking residues 566-635 of the cytosolic domain also accumulated near marginal lamellae. In contrast, the focal distribution observed in adherent cells was not detectable in cells grown in suspension. Fluorescence ratio imaging was used to define the functional consequences of focal accumulation of NHE-1. In the steady state, the pH was virtually identical throughout the cytosol. Moreover, no pH gradients were found to develop when cells recovered from an acid load by activation of Na+/H+ exchange. This is probably because of the presence of high concentrations of mobile buffers in the cytosol. The focal accumulation of antiporters near the cell margins may be involved in stimulation by adherence and/or generation of local osmotic gradients.},

Reported fluorescence nanoscopy variants switch these features either with intense beams at defined positions or randomly, molecule by molecule. Here we demonstrate an optical nanoscopy that records raw data images from living cells and tissues with low levels of light. This advance has been facilitated by the generation of reversibly switchable enhanced green fluorescent protein (rsEGFP), a fluorescent protein that can be reversibly photoswitched more than a thousand times. Distributions of functional rsEGFP-fusion proteins in living bacteria and mammalian cells are imaged at <40-nanometre resolution. Dendritic spines in living brain slices are super-resolved with about a million times lower light intensities than before. The reversible switching also enables all-optical writing of features with subdiffraction size and spacings, which can be used for data storage.},

  Abstract                 = {Ca2+-activated K+ channels of big (hBK), intermediate (hIK) or small (rSK3) conductance were co-expressed with aquaporin 1 (AQP1) in Xenopus laevis oocytes. hBK channels were activated by depolarization, whereas hIK and rSK3 channels were activated by direct injection of Ca2+ or Cd2+ into the oocyte cytoplasm, before the oocytes were subjected to hyperosmolar or hypoosmolar (+/-50 mOsm mannitol) challenges. In all cases, the oocytes responded rapidly to the osmotic changes with shrinkage or swelling and the effects on the K+ currents were measured. hIK and rSK3 currents were highly sensitive to volume changes and increased immediately to 178\% (hIK) or 165\% (rSK3) of control in response to swelling and decreased to 64\% (hIK) or 61\% (rSK3) of control after shrinkage. These responses were dependent on the channels being pre-activated and were almost totally abolished after injection of cytochalasin D into the oocyte cytoplasm (final concentration: 1 microM). In contrast, hBK channels showed only a minor sensitivity to volume changes; the hBK channel activity decreased approximately 20\% after swelling and increased approximately 20\% after shrinkage. The opposite effects of volume changes on hIK/rSK3 and hBK channels suggest that the significant stimulation of hIK and rSK3 channels during swelling is not mediated by changes in intracellular Ca2+, but rather through interactions with the cytoskeleton, provided that a sufficient basal concentration of intracellular Ca2+ or Cd2+ is present.},

  Abstract                 = {Cell specialization is often governed by the spatial distribution of ion channels and receptors on the cell surface. So far, little is known about functional ion channel localization. This is due to a lack of satisfactory methods for investigating ion channels in an intact cell and simultaneously determining the channels' positions accurately. We have developed a novel high-resolution scanning patch-clamp technique that enables the study of ion channels, not only in small cells, such as sperm, but in submicrometer cellular structures, such as epithelial microvilli, fine neuronal dendrites, and, particularly, T-tubule openings of cardiac myocytes. In cardiac myocytes, as in most excitable cells, action potential propagation depends essentially on the properties of ion channels that are functionally and spatially coupled. We found that the L-type calcium and chloride channels are distributed and colocalized in the region of T-tubule openings, but not in other regions of the myocyte. In addition, chloride channels were found in narrowly defined regions of Z-grooves. This finding suggests a new synergism between these types of channels that may be relevant for action potential propagation along the T-tubule system and excitation-contraction coupling.},

This is due to the cell size and angular shape in combination with their motility. Using a refined technique, specifically for patch clamping spermatozoa, we have made recordings from human cells. This technique permitted approaches which enable functional analysis of sperm ion channels, including acquisition of inside-out patches, generation of averaged currents, and observation of the effects of pharmacological manipulation during prolonged recordings. As well as a low conductance (7 pS) channel and a 25-pS channel, the most striking finding was the presence of very high conductance, 4-aminopyridine-sensitive multistate channels resembling the non-selective cation channel of sea urchin and mouse spermatozoa. Application of 2 mM 4-aminopyridine (a dose sufficient to cause channel blockade) caused an instant and dramatic transition of motility in the sperm population increasing hyperactivated motility by more than 10-fold as assessed by computer-assisted semen analysis. Combined application of patch clamp and pharmacological investigation of mature sperm cells and will permit rapid advances in our understanding the role of ion channels in sperm function.},

  Abstract                 = {In the mammalian CNS, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) express most neurotransmitter receptors, but their function remains unclear. The current studies suggest a physiological role for glutamate (AMPA and/or kainate) receptors in OPC migration. AMPA stimulated alphav integrin-mediated OPC migration by increasing both the rate of cell movement and the frequency of Ca2+ transients. A protein complex containing the myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) and alphav integrin modulated the AMPA-stimulated migration, and stimulation of OPC AMPA receptors resulted in increased association of the AMPA receptor subunits themselves with the alphav integrin/PLP complex. Thus, after AMPA receptor stimulation, an alphav integrin/PLP/neurotransmitter receptor protein complex forms that reduces binding to the extracellular matrix and enhances OPC migration. To assess the extent to which PLP was involved in the AMPA-stimulated migration, OPCs from the myelin-deficient (MD) rat, which has a PLP gene mutation, were analyzed. OPCs from the MD rat had a normal basal migration rate, but AMPA did not stimulate the migration of these cells, suggesting that the PLP/alphav integrin complex was important for the AMPA-mediated induction. AMPA-induced modulation of OPC migration was abolished by pertussis toxin, although baseline migration was normal. Thus, G-protein-dependent signaling is crucial for AMPA-stimulated migration of OPCs but not for basal OPC migration. Other signaling pathways involved in this AMPA-stimulated OPC migration were also determined. These studies highlight novel signaling determinants of OPC migration and suggest that glutamate could play a pivotal role in regulating integrin-mediated OPC migration.},

We have described a new class of fluorescent analogues termed optical biosensors, which sense chemical or molecular events through their effects on protein transducers. One example of this new class of indicators is MeroCaM, an environmentally sensitive fluorophore which when it is attached to calmodulin reflects the activation of calmodulin by calcium in vitro. We report here that the rise in free calcium and MeroCaM activation occur in the same period during serum stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts. MeroCaM activation also correlates with the spatial pattern of increased free calcium and the contraction of transverse fibres during wound healing. Finally, migrating fibroblasts in the later stages of wound-healing exhibit an increasing gradient of free calcium and MeroCaM activation from the front to the rear.},

Hyposmotic challenge was associated with a rapid, transient current coincident with the onset of cell swelling; cell volume subsequently recovered towards control values (regulatory volume decrease; RVD). The transient swelling-induced current (I(swell)) reversed at +15 mV, and was not found to be carried exclusively by any single ion in the physiological solutions. I(swell) was abolished by gadolinium (Gd3+), a blocker of stretch-activated ion channels, and was absent when the cytoskeleton was disrupted by treatment with cytochalasin B. I(swell) was also prevented when intracellular [Ca2+] was buffered with BAPTA AM. Under those experimental conditions which prevented the generation of I(swell), cell volume regulation failed so that the cells remained swollen in hyposmotic solution. Our data reveal a functional relationship between I(swell) and RVD, whereby I(swell) is a necessary prerequisite, although not exclusively sufficient, for volume recovery following cell swelling. We propose that I(swell) is an important early signalling event which activates subsequent mechanisms to regulate cell volume.},

  Abstract                 = {The organometallic dye, ruthenium red (RR) inhibited Ca++ influx, omega-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive Ca++ binding and Ca(++)-dependent neurotransmitter release in a qualitatively similar manner in rat and chicken synaptosomes and in mammalian neuromuscular preparations, but had no effect on Ca(++)-dependent processes mediated by the dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca++ channel. These effects are specific for the RR complex, as RuCl3 affected neither Ca++ influx, omega-conotoxin GVIA binding nor neurotransmitter release, but did, however, in contrast to RR, displace [3H]nitrendipine from synaptosomes. RR, in a manner similar to omega-conotoxin MVIIC and omega-agatoxin IVA (AgaIVA), also effectively inhibited the response of the rat diaphragm to nerve stimulation and blocked AgaIVA-sensitive Ca++ influx in the rat brain, suggesting a significant interaction at the P-type voltage-sensitive Ca++ channel. These effects of RR suggest that this amino complex affects both the N and the P domain of the Ca++ channel in the chicken brain and both the N- and P-type Ca++ channel which is intimately coupled to the Ca++ influx and neurotransmitter release in rat synaptosomes. Its ability to block all of the Ca++ influx in mammalian brain preparations and to inhibit completely the nerve-stimulated rat neuromuscular junction certainly indicates a significant action at the P-type voltage-sensitive Ca++ channel, similar to omega-conotoxin MVIIC or AgaIVA. RR should prove to be a valuable synthetic, inexpensive tool with which to probe the neuropharmacology of the mammalian neurotransmitter-linked voltage-sensitive Ca++ channels.},

The probe of the SICM is an electrolyte-filled micropipette. The flow of ions through the opening of the pipette is blocked at short distances between the probe and the surface, thus, limiting the ion conductance. A feedback mechanism can be used to maintain a given conductance and in turn determine the distance to the surface. The SICM can also sample and image the local ion currents above the surfaces. To illustrate its potential for imaging ion currents through channels in membranes, a topographic image of a membrane filter with 0.80-micrometer pores and an image of the ion currents flowing through such pores are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Here we describe the use of pulse-mode scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) to observe volume changes and cell membrane movements during the locomotion of cultured cells in the range of minutes to several hours. The microscope is based on the pulse-mode SICM previously developed for stable imaging of single cells in culture. Our instrument uses current pulses to control the distance between cell surface and electrode tip as well as a back-step mode to prevent contact of tip and membrane during lateral movements of the probe. We performed repeated scans of cell surfaces using feedback-controlled piezoactors to position the electrode. Using patch-clamp-type electrode tips the height of cells could reproducibly be measured with a standard deviation of 50 nm. To quantify and separate changes in cell position and volume occurring between consecutive scans, a program was written to subtract images and calculate volume changes. Examples of repeated scans show that membrane movements in the range of 30 min to a few hours can be quantitatively monitored with a lateral resolution of 500 nm using difference images and that faster movements in the range of minutes can be recorded at defined cell sections using the line scan mode. Difference images indicate that volume changes can affect cell surfaces inhomogeneously, emphasizing the role of the cytoskeleton in the stabilization of cell shape.},

Whereas light microscopy in principle enables one to obtain three dimensional data, the reconstruction of cell volume from z-stacks is a time consuming procedure. Thus, three dimensional topographic representations of cells are easier to obtain by scanning probe microscopical measurements.We present a method of separating the cell soma volume of bipolar cells in adherent cell cultures from the contributions of the cell processes from data obtained by scanning ion conductance microscopy. Soma volume changes between successive scans obtained from the same cell can then be computed even if the cell is changing its position within the observed area. We demonstrate that the estimation of the cell volume on the basis of the width and the length of a cell may lead to erroneous determination of cell volume changes.We provide a new algorithm to repeatedly determine single cell soma volume and thus to quantify cell volume changes during cell movements occuring over a time range of hours.},

The mechanism of cell migration in general is not yet completely understood. Nevertheless, evidence is accumulating that besides the coordinated rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, a finetuned interplay of ion and water fluxes across the cell membrane is essential for cell migration. One part of a general hypothesis is that a local volume increase towards the direction of movement triggers a mechano-activated calcium influx that regulates various procedures at the rear end of a migrating cell. Here, we investigated cell volume changes of migrating OPCs using scanning ion conductance microscopy. We found that during accelerated migration OPCs undergo an increase in the frontal cell body volume. These findings are supplemented with time lapse calcium imaging data that hint an increase in calcium content the frontal part of the cell soma.},

  Abstract                 = {The detection and removal of bacteria, such as E. coli in aqueous environments by using safe and readily available means is of high importance. Here we report on the synthesis of nanodiamonds (ND) covalently modified with specific carbohydrates (glyco-ND) for the precipitation of type 1 fimbriated uropathogenic E. coli in solution by mechanically stable agglutination. The surface of the diamond nanoparticles was modified by using a Diels-Alder reaction followed by the covalent grafting of the respective glycosides. The resulting glyco-ND samples are fully dispersible in aqueous media and show a surface loading of typically 0.1 mmol g(-1). To probe the adhesive properties of various ND samples we have developed a new sandwich assay employing layers of two bacterial strains in an array format. Agglutination experiments in solution were used to distinguish unspecific interactions of glyco-ND with bacteria from specific ones. Two types of precipitates in solution were observed and characterized in detail by light and electron microscopy. Only by specific interactions mechanically stable agglutinates were formed. Bacteria could be removed from water by filtration of these stable agglutinates through 10 μm pore-size filters and the ND conjugate could eventually be recovered by addition of the appropriate carbohydrate. The application of glycosylated ND allows versatile and facile detection of bacteria and their efficient removal by using an environmentally and biomedically benign material.},

  Abstract                 = {Extending axons in the developing nervous system are guided to their targets through the coordinate actions of attractive and repulsive guidance cues. The semaphorin family of guidance cues comprises several members that can function as diffusible axonal chemorepellents. To begin to elucidate the mechanisms that mediate the repulsive actions of Collapsin-1/Semaphorin III/D (Sema III), we searched for Sema III-binding proteins in embryonic rat sensory neurons by expression cloning. We report that Sema III binds with high affinity to the transmembrane protein neuropilin, and that antibodies to neuropilin block the ability of Sema III to repel sensory axons and to induce collapse of their growth cones. These results provide evidence that neuropilin is a receptor or a component of a receptor complex that mediates the effects of Sema III on these axons.},

The diffraction barrier limiting far-field light microscopy is outperformed by using stimulated emission depletion. We used the tagging protein hAGT (SNAP-tag), which covalently binds benzylguanine-substituted organic dyes, for labeling. Tetramethylrhodamine was used to image the cytoskeleton (vimentin and microtubule-associated protein 2) as well as structures located at the cell membrane (caveolin and connexin-43) with a resolution down to 40 nm. Comparison with structures labeled with the yellow fluorescent protein Citrine validates this labeling approach. Nanoscopic movies showing the movement of connexin-43 clusters across the cell membrane evidence the capability of this technique to observe structural changes on the nanoscale over time. Pulsed or continuous-wave lasers for excitation and stimulated emission depletion yield images of similar resolution in living cells. Hence fusion proteins that bind modified organic dyes expand widely the application range of far-field fluorescence nanoscopy of living cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Fluorescence microscopy is indispensable in many areas of science, but until recently, diffraction has limited the resolution of its lens-based variant. The diffraction barrier has been broken by a saturated depletion of the marker's fluorescent state by stimulated emission, but this approach requires picosecond laser pulses of GW/cm2 intensity. Here, we demonstrate the surpassing of the diffraction barrier in fluorescence microscopy with illumination intensities that are eight orders of magnitude smaller. The subdiffraction resolution results from reversible photoswitching of a marker protein between a fluorescence-activated and a nonactivated state, whereby one of the transitions is accomplished by means of a spatial intensity distribution featuring a zero. After characterizing the switching kinetics of the used marker protein asFP595, we demonstrate the current capability of this RESOLFT (reversible saturable optical fluorescence transitions) type of concept to resolve 50-100 nm in the focal plane. The observed resolution is limited only by the photokinetics of the protein and the perfection of the zero. Our results underscore the potential to finally achieve molecular resolution in fluorescence microscopy by technical optimization.},

Here we present the combination of super-resolution STED microscopy with scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (scanning STED-FCS, sSTED-FCS) to characterize the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of lipid interactions. sSTED-FCS reveals transient molecular interaction hotspots for a fluorescent sphingolipid analogue. The interaction sites are smaller than 80 nm in diameter and lipids are transiently trapped for several milliseconds in these areas. In comparison, newly developed fluorescent phospholipid and cholesterol analogues with improved phase-partitioning properties show more homogenous diffusion, independent of the preference for liquid-ordered or disordered membrane environments. Our results do not support the presence of nanodomains based on lipid-phase separation in the basal membrane of our cultured nonstimulated cells, and show that alternative interactions are responsible for the strong local trapping of our sphingolipid analogue.},

The median duration of progression-free survival was 10.6 months in the group given IFL plus bevacizumab, as compared with 6.2 months in the group given IFL plus placebo (hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.54; P<0.001); the corresponding rates of response were 44.8 percent and 34.8 percent (P=0.004). The median duration of the response was 10.4 months in the group given IFL plus bevacizumab, as compared with 7.1 months in the group given IFL plus placebo (hazard ratio for progression, 0.62; P=0.001). Grade 3 hypertension was more common during treatment with IFL plus bevacizumab than with IFL plus placebo (11.0 percent vs. 2.3 percent) but was easily managed.The addition of bevacizumab to fluorouracil-based combination chemotherapy results in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in survival among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {Prolonged mechanical unloading (UN) of the heart is associated with detrimental changes to the structure and function of cardiomyocytes. The mechanisms underlying these changes are unknown. In this study, we report the influence of UN on excitation-contraction coupling, Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) in particular, and transverse (t)-tubule structure. UN was induced in male Lewis rat hearts by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation. Left ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated from the transplanted hearts after 4 wk and studied using whole-cell patch clamping, confocal microscopy, and scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM). Recipient hearts were used as control (C). UN reduced the volume of cardiomyocytes by 56.5\% compared with C (UN, n=90; C, n=59; P<0.001). The variance of time-to-peak of the Ca(2+) transients was significantly increased in unloaded cardiomyocytes (UN 227.4+/-24.9 ms(2), n=42 vs. C 157.8+/-18.0 ms(2), n=40; P<0.05). UN did not alter the action potential morphology or whole-cell L-type Ca(2+) current compared with C, but caused a significantly higher Ca(2+) spark frequency (UN 3.718+/-0.85 events/100 mum/s, n=47 vs. C 0.908+/-0.186 events/100 microm/s, n=45; P<0.05). Confocal studies showed irregular distribution of the t tubules (power of the normal t-tubule frequency: UN 8.13+/-1.12x10(5), n=57 vs. C 20.60+/- 3.174x10(5), n=56; P<0.001) and SICM studies revealed a profound disruption to the openings of the t tubules and the cell surface in unloaded cardiomyocytes. We show that UN leads to a functional uncoupling of the CICR process and identify disruption of the t-tubule-sarcoplasmic reticulum interaction as a possible mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) is critical for contraction in cardiomyocytes. The transverse (t)-tubule system guarantees the proximity of the triggers for Ca(2+) release [L-type Ca(2+) channel, dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs)] and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release channels [ryanodine receptors (RyRs)]. Transverse tubule disruption occurs early in heart failure (HF). Clinical studies of left ventricular assist devices in HF indicate that mechanical unloading induces reverse remodelling. We hypothesize that unloading of failing hearts normalizes t-tubule structure and improves CICR.Heart failure was induced in Lewis rats by left coronary artery ligation for 12 weeks; sham-operated animals were used as controls. Failing hearts were mechanically unloaded for 4 weeks by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation (HF-UN). HF reduced the t-tubule density measured by di-8-ANEPPS staining in isolated left ventricular myocytes, and this was reversed by unloading. The deterioration in the regularity of the t-tubule system in HF was also reversed in HF-UN. Scanning ion conductance microscopy showed the reappearance of normal surface striations in HF-UN. Electron microscopy revealed recovery of normal t-tubule microarchitecture in HF-UN. L-type Ca(2+) current density, measured using whole-cell patch clamping, was reduced in HF but unaffected by unloading. The variance of the time-to-peak of the Ca(2+) transient, an index of CICR dyssynchrony, was increased in HF and normalized by unloading. The increased Ca(2+) spark frequency observed in HF was reduced in HF-UN. These results could be explained by the recoupling of orphaned RyRs in HF, as indicated by immunofluorescence.Our data show that mechanical unloading of the failing heart reverses the pathological remodelling of the t-tubule system and improves CICR.},

However, the lipid raft field is now at a technical impasse because the physical tools to study biological membranes as a liquid that is ordered in space and time are still being developed. This has lead to a disconnection between the concept of lipid rafts as derived from biochemical and biophysical assays and their existence in the cell. Here, we compare the concept of lipid rafts as it has emerged from the study of synthetic membranes with the reality of lateral heterogeneity in biological membranes. Further application of existing tools and the development of new tools are needed to understand the dynamic heterogeneity of biological membranes.},

We report an almost ideal realization of that gedanken experiment with single photons allowing unambiguous which-way measurements. The choice between open and closed configurations, made by a quantum random number generator, is relativistically separated from the entry of the photon into the interferometer.},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of a nonuniform solute concentration on the osmotic transport of water through the boundaries of a simple model cell is investigated. A system of two ordinary differential equations is derived for the motion of a single cell in the limit of a fast solute diffusion, and an analytic solution is obtained for one special case. A two-dimensional finite element model has been developed to simulate the more general case (finite diffusion rates, solute gradient induced by a solidification front). It is shown that the cell moves to regions of lower solute concentration due to the uneven flux of water through the cell boundaries. This mechanism has apparently not been discussed previously. The magnitude of this effect is small for red blood cells, the case in which all of the relevant parameters are known. We show, however, that it increases with cell size and membrane permeability, so this effect could be important for larger cells. The finite element model presented should also have other applications in the study of the response of cells to an osmotic stress and for the interaction of cells and solidification fronts. Such investigations are of major relevance for the optimization of cryopreservation processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Cardiac myocytes express protein kinase A-dependent Cl(-) (Cl(PKA)) channels that are thought to represent cardiac expression of CFTR. In the present study, the 'Smart' patch clamp technique was used to investigate the distribution of Cl(PKA) channels at the cell surface of isolated guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. Imaging the cell surface using scanning ion conductance microscopy allowed the identification of the mouths to t-tubules and lateral z-grooves with a spacing of 1.86 microm. Cell-attached patch clamp recordings were made from specified locations within the imaged area. Perfusion of the cells with an activating cocktail of isoprenaline (5 microM), forskolin (10 microM) and isobutylmethylxanthine (50 microM) activated large, noisy anion-selective currents in which unitary channel currents could not be identified. Currents were recorded both from within z-grooves and in the inter-groove region but not at the mouths of t-tubules. Power spectral and noise analyses indicated the involvement of 13.5pS channels occurring in clusters of >50 channels. Channel activity was lost on excision of the patch from the cell but could be recovered in inside-out excised patches by application of the catalytic subunit of PKA.

  Abstract                 = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),which is prominently involved in angiogenesis, also exerts direct effects on neurons, leading to neurite extension, neuroprotection, and neurogenesis. However, the signal transduction pathways employed by VEGF in neurons are incompletely understood. We investigated the molecular mechanisms through which VEGF stimulates neurogenesis in primary cultures of rat cerebral cortical neurons. VEGF increased neurite outgrowth, measured using a colorimetric assay for cresyl violet staining of neuronal processes, with half-maximal enhancement at 10 ng/mL and maximal, approximately 60\% enhancement at 30-100 ng/mL. The effect of VEGF was not reproduced by VEGF-B or placental growth factor, but was blocked by SU1498, consistent with a VEGFR2 receptor-mediated process. VEGF-induced neurite outgrowth was also blocked by the ROK inhibitor Y27632 and the Rho inhibitors sulindac and Clostridium botulium exoenzyme C3, and was accompanied by Y27632-sensitive phosphorylation of cofilin, a downstream mediator of Rho/ROK signaling. We conclude that VEGF promotes neurite outgrowth from cerebral cortical neurons by interacting with VEGFR2 and activating Rho/ROK signaling pathways.},

  Abstract                 = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic protein with neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects. Because VEGF promotes the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells, we examined the possibility that it also stimulates the proliferation of neuronal precursors in murine cerebral cortical cultures and in adult rat brain in vivo. VEGF (>10 ng/ml) stimulated 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation into cells that expressed immature neuronal marker proteins and increased cell number in cultures by 20-30\%. Cultured cells labeled by BrdUrd expressed VEGFR2/Flk-1, but not VEGFR1/Flt-1 receptors, and the effect of VEGF was blocked by the VEGFR2/Flk-1 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU1498. Intracerebroventricular administration of VEGF into rat brain increased BrdUrd labeling of cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), where VEGFR2/Flk-1 was colocalized with the immature neuronal marker, doublecortin (Dcx). The increase in BrdUrd labeling after the administration of VEGF was caused by an increase in cell proliferation, rather than a decrease in cell death, because VEGF did not reduce caspase-3 cleavage in SVZ or SGZ. Cells labeled with BrdUrd after VEGF treatment in vivo include immature and mature neurons, astroglia, and endothelial cells. These findings implicate the angiogenesis factor VEGF in neurogenesis as well.},

  Abstract                 = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic factor with neurotrophic effects in the peripheral nervous system. To determine if VEGF can also promote the survival of central neurons, we examined its effect on HN33 (mouse hippocampal neuron x neuroblastoma) cells deprived of serum. Serum-deprived HN33 cells expressed VEGFR-2 receptors, which, in the presence of VEGF, interacted with the downstream signaling molecules phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and phospho-Akt, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Treatment of serum-deprived HN33 cells with VEGF also stimulated the phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Withdrawal of serum for 24 h reduced HN33 cell viability by approximately 50\% in the absence of VEGF, but by only approximately 20\% in the presence of 100 ng/mL of VEGF. These findings support a neurotrophic role for VEGF in the central nervous system, which may be mediated through VEGFR-2 receptors, the protein kinases phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and Akt, and the transcription factor NK-kappaB. Thus, VEGF, like other neurotrophic factors, could exert protective effects in acute or chronic neurodegenerative disorders.},

Migration of transformed MDCK-F cells depends on activation of a charybdotoxin-sensitive, volume-activated membrane K+ current. Thus, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology and transwell migration assays to determine whether HGF/SF stimulation of MDCK II cell migration depends on the activation of membrane K+ currents. HGF/SF activated a membrane K+ current that increased over 24 hr, and which could be modulated by increasing intracellular calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i. Charybdotoxin (ChTX, 50 nM), iberiotoxin (IbTX, 100 nM), stichodactyla toxin (Stk, 100 nM) and clotrimazole (CLT, 1 mM) all inhibited this current. HGF/SF (100 scatter units/ml) significantly increased MDCK II cell migration over 8 hr compared to control cells. Addition of ChTX (50 nM), IbTX (100 nM), Stk (100 nM) or CLT (1 microM) inhibited the HGF/SF-stimulated MDCK II cell migration. We conclude that the activation of membrane Ca2+-activated K+current is necessary for HGF/SF stimulation of MDCK II cell.},

The method uses the hydrodynamic drag forces arising from a flow through a conical pipette with a tip radius of 1-1.5 μm, placed approximately 1 μm above the investigated SLB. This results in a localized forcefield that acts on molecules protruding from the SLB, yielding a hydrodynamic trap with a size approximately given by the size of the pipette tip. We demonstrate this concept by trapping the protein streptavidin, bound to biotin receptors in the SLB. It is also shown how static and kinetic information about the intermolecular interactions in the lipid bilayer can be obtained by relating how the magnitude of the hydrodynamic forces affects the accumulation of protein molecules in the trap.},

  abstract = {The excitotoxicity of glutamate is believed to be mediated by sustained increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Mitochondria play a vital role in buffering the cytosolic calcium overload in stimulated neurons. Here we have studied the glutamate induced Ca2+ signals in cortical brain slices under physiological conditions and the conditions that modify the mitochondrial functions. Exposure of slices to glutamate caused a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i followed by a slow and persistently rising phase. The rapid increase in [Ca2+]i was mainly due to influx of Ca2+ through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels. Glutamate stimulation in the absence of Ca2+ in the extracellular medium elicited a small transient rise in [Ca2+]i which can be attributed to the mobilization of Ca2+ from IP3 sensitive endoplasmic reticulum pools consequent to activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. The glutamate induced Ca2+ influx was accompanied by depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, which was inhibited by ruthenium red, the blocker of mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter. These results imply that mitochondria sequester the Ca2+ loaded into the cytosol by glutamate stimulation. Persistent depolarization of mitochondrial membrane observed in presence of extracellular Ca2+ caused permeability transition and released the sequestered Ca2+ which is manifested as slow rise in [Ca2+]i. Protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP) depolarized the mitochondrial membrane and enhanced the glutamate induced [Ca2+]i response. Contrary to this, treatment of slices with mitochondrial inhibitor oligomycin or ruthenium red markedly reduced the [Ca2+]i response. Combined treatment with oligomycin and rotenone further diminished the [Ca2+]i response and also abolished the CCCP mediated rise in [Ca2+]i. However, rotenone alone had no effect on glutamate induced [Ca2+]i response. These changes in glutamate-induced [Ca2+]i response could not be explained on the basis of deficient mitochondrial Ca2+ sequestration or ATP dependent Ca2+ buffering. The mitochondrial inhibitors reduced the cellular ATP/ADP ratio, however, this would have restrained the ATP dependent Ca2+ buffering processes leading to elevation of [Ca2+]i. In contrast our results showed repression of Ca2+ signal except in case of CCCP which drastically reduced the ATP/ADP ratio. It was inferred that, under the conditions that hamper the Ca2+ sequestering ability of mitochondria, the glutamate induced Ca2+ influx could be impeded. To validate this, influx of Mn2+ through ionotropic glutamate receptor channel was monitored by measuring the quenching of Fura-2 fluorescence. Treatment of slices with oligomycin and rotenone prior to glutamate exposure conspicuously reduced the rate of glutamate induced fluorescence quenching as compared to untreated slices. Thus our data establish that the functional status of mitochondria can modify the activity of ionotropic glutamate receptor and suggest that blockade of mitochondrial Ca2+ sequestration may desensitize the NMDA receptor operated channel.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel optical technique for three-dimensional tracking of single fluorescent particles using a modified epifluorescence microscope containing a weak cylindrical lens in the detection optics and a microstepper-controlled fine focus. Images of small, fluorescent particles were circular in focus but ellipsoidal above and below focus; the major axis of the ellipsoid shifted by 90 degrees in going through focus. Particle z position was determined from the image shape and orientation by applying a peak detection algorithm to image projections along the x and y axes; x, y position was determined from the centroid of the particle image. Typical spatial resolution was 12 nm along the optical axis and 5 nm in the image plane with a maximum sampling rate of 3-4 Hz. The method was applied to track fluorescent particles in artificial solutions and living cells. In a solution of viscosity 30 cP, the mean squared distance (MSD) traveled by a 264 nm diameter rhodamine-labeled bead was linear with time to 20 s. The measured diffusion coefficient, 0.0558 +/- 0.001 micron2/s (SE, n = 4), agreed with the theoretical value of 0.0556 micron2/s. Statistical variability of MSD curves for a freely diffusing bead was in quantitative agreement with Monte Carlo simulations of three-dimensional random walks. In a porous glass matrix, the MSD data was curvilinear and showed reduced bead diffusion. In cytoplasm of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, bead diffusion was restricted. The water permeability in individual Chinese Hamster Ovary cells was measured from the z movement of a fluorescent bead fixed at the cell surface in response osmotic gradients; water permeability was increased by > threefold in cells expressing CHIP28 water channels. The simplicity and precision of this tracking method may be useful to quantify the complex trajectories of fluorescent particles in living cells.},

  Abstract                 = {A defining feature of glial cells has been their inability to generate action potentials. We show here that there are two distinct types of morphologically identical oligodendrocyte precursor glial cells (OPCs) in situ in rat CNS white matter. One type expresses voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels, generates action potentials when depolarized and senses its environment by receiving excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input from axons. The other type lacks action potentials and synaptic input. We found that when OPCs suffered glutamate-mediated damage, as occurs in cerebral palsy, stroke and spinal cord injury, the action potential-generating OPCs were preferentially damaged, as they expressed more glutamate receptors, and received increased spontaneous glutamatergic synaptic input in ischemia. These data challenge the idea that only neurons generate action potentials in the CNS and imply that the development of therapies for demyelinating disorders will require defining which OPC type can carry out remyelination.},

Here we provide evidence that the small GTPase Drac1 also plays a key role in this guidance process. Neuronal expression of the dominant negative mutation Drac1(N17) causes axons to bypass and extend beyond normal synaptic partners. This phenotype is consistently reproduced by pharmacological blockade of actin assembly. Genetic interactions between Drac1(N17) and the receptor-tyrosine phosphatase Dlar suggest that intersegmental nerve b guidance requires the integration of multiple, convergent signals.},

Several fusions between Cre recombinase and the hormone binding domain (HBD) of a mutated human progesterone receptor, which binds RU 486 but not progesterone, were constructed. When tested in transient expression assays recombination activities of all fusion proteins were responsive to RU 486, but not to the endogenous steroid progesterone. However, the observed induction of recombination activity by the synthetic steroid varied between the different fusion proteins. The fusion with the highest activity in the presence of RU 486 combined with low background activity in the absence of the steroid was tested after stable expression in fibroblast and embryonal stem (ES) cells. We could demonstrate that its recombination activity was highly dependent on RU 486. Since the RU 486 doses required to activate recombination were considerably lower than doses displaying anti-progesterone effects in mice, this system could be used as a valuable tool for inducible gene targeting.},

  Abstract                 = {Primary human alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells were immortalized by transduction with the catalytic subunit of telomerase and simian virus 40 large-tumor antigen. Characterization by immunochemical and morphologic methods demonstrated an AT1-like cell phenotype. Unlike primary AT2 cells, immortalized cells no longer expressed alkaline phosphatase, pro-surfactant protein C, and thyroid transcription factor-1, but expressed increased caveolin-1 and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). Live cell imaging using scanning ion conductance microscopy showed that the cuboidal primary AT2 cells were approximately 15 microm and enriched with surface microvilli, while the immortal AT1 cells were attenuated more than 40 microm, resembling these cells in situ. Transmission electron microscopy highlighted the attenuated morphology and showed endosomal vesicles in some immortal AT1 cells (but not primary AT2 cells) as found in situ. Particulate air pollution exacerbates cardiopulmonary disease. Interaction of ultrafine, nano-sized particles with the alveolar epithelium and/or translocation into the cardiovasculature may be a contributory factor. We hypothesized differential uptake of nanoparticles by AT1 and AT2 cells, depending on particle size and surface charge. Uptake of 50-nm and 1-microm fluorescent latex particles was investigated using confocal microscopy and scanning surface confocal microscopy of live cells. Fewer than 10\% of primary AT2 cells internalized particles. In contrast, 75\% immortal AT1 cells internalized negatively charged particles, while less than 55\% of these cells internalized positively charged particles; charge, rather than size, mattered. The process was rapid: one-third of the total cell-associated negatively charged 50-nm particle fluorescence measured at 24 hours was internalized during the first hour. AT1 cells could be important in translocation of particles from the lung into the circulation.},

  Abstract                 = {The plasma membrane is of central importance in the motility process. It defines the boundary separating the intracellular and extracellular environments, and mediates the interactions between a motile cell and its environment. Furthermore, the membrane serves as a dynamic platform for localization of various components which actively participate in all aspects of the motility process, including force generation, adhesion, signaling, and regulation. Membrane transport between internal membranes and the plasma membrane, and in particular polarized membrane transport, facilitates continuous reorganization of the plasma membrane and is thought to be involved in maintaining polarity and recycling of essential components in some motile cell types. Beyond its biochemical composition, the mechanical characteristics of the plasma membrane and, in particular, membrane tension are of central importance in cell motility; membrane tension affects the rates of all the processes which involve membrane deformation including edge extension, endocytosis, and exocytosis. Most importantly, the mechanical characteristics of the membrane and its biochemical composition are tightly intertwined; membrane tension and local curvature are largely determined by the biochemical composition of the membrane and the biochemical reactions taking place; at the same time, curvature and tension affect the localization of components and reaction rates. This review focuses on this dynamic interplay and the feedbacks between the biochemical and biophysical characteristics of the membrane and their effects on cell movement. New insight on these will be crucial for understanding the motility process.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently we have shown that the majority of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) dies via activation of caspase-3 after transection of the optic nerve (ON) in the adult rat. In the present study we investigated whether insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), an important factor in retinal development, prevents secondary death of RGCs after axotomy. Moreover, we studied potential intracellular mechanisms of IGF-mediated neuroprotection in more detail. Our results indicate that intraocular application of IGF-I protects RGCs from death after ON transection in a dose-dependent manner. We show reduced caspase-3 activity as one possible neuroprotective mechanism of IGF-I treatment in vivo. Caspase-3 mRNA expression remained unchanged. Because caspase inhibition can be mediated by Akt in vitro, we examined phosphorylation of Akt after axotomy and under IGF treatment. Western blot analysis revealed decreased Akt phosphorylation after axotomy without treatment and an increased phosphorylation of Akt under treatment with IGF-I. This strong increase could be reduced by simultaneous injection of wortmannin (WM), a potent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). To prove the pathway suggested by these experiments as relevant for the in vivo situation, we assessed the number of RGCs 14 d after ON transection under a combined treatment strategy of IGF-I and WM. As expected, WM significantly reduced the neuroprotective effects of IGF-I. In summary, we show for the first time in vivo that IGF is neuroprotective via PI3-K-dependent Akt phosphorylation and by inhibition of caspase-3.},

  Abstract                 = {The developmental origin of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) in the forebrain has been controversial. We now show, by Cre-lox fate mapping in transgenic mice, that the first OLPs originate in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and anterior entopeduncular area (AEP) in the ventral forebrain. From there, they populate the entire embryonic telencephalon including the cerebral cortex before being joined by a second wave of OLPs from the lateral and/or caudal ganglionic eminences (LGE and CGE). Finally, a third wave arises within the postnatal cortex. When any one population is destroyed at source by the targeted expression of diphtheria toxin, the remaining cells take over and the mice survive and behave normally, with a normal complement of oligodendrocytes and myelin. Thus, functionally redundant populations of OLPs compete for space in the developing brain. Notably, the embryonic MGE- and AEP-derived population is eliminated during postnatal life, raising questions about the nature and purpose of the competition.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies have demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor VEGFR2 (flk-1) are expressed by neurons during development and following hypoxic-ischemic events. Moreover, fetal CNS tissue explants exposed to exogenous VEGF exhibit increased neuronal Map-2 expression, suggesting that VEGF could have an effect on neuronal maturation. To determine whether this effect is of a direct nature, we examined the expression of Map-2 in the presence of VEGF in primary CNS neuronal cultures. After 3 days in culture, a statistically significant dose-dependent increase in the length of Map-2(+) processes was observed, with the peak occurring at 10 ng/ml of VEGF. Immunohistochemical analysis of the cultures demonstrated the presence of VEGFR2 after VEGF treatment, as well as the expression of the VEGF receptor VEGFR1 (flt-1). Treatment of the cultures with antisense oligonucleotides against VEGFR2, but not against VEGFR1, abolished the effect of VEGF on the length of Map-2(+) processes. RT-PCR analyses of Map-2 and VEGFR1 indicated that mRNAs of these two genes are upregulated in the presence of VEGF. The addition of wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt signal-transduction pathway, to the media did not affect the VEGF-dependent increase in Map-2(+) length. In contrast PD98059, which inhibits the MAPK pathway, partially abolished this effect of VEGF. These experiments suggest that VEGF has a direct effect on neuronal growth and maturation under normoxic conditions during CNS development, which is mediated by the VEGFR2 receptor via the MAPK pathway.},

  abstract    = {This paper summarizes outcomes of a single-center study of intracavitary brachytherapy (IBT) with stereotactically applied phosphorus-32 ((32)P) colloid for treatment of cystic craniopharyngiomas. We assessed its efficacy and safety, on the basis of clinical and radiological outcomes in one of the largest reported patient series. Between 1992 and 2011, 53 patients were treated with IBT, 14 without previous treatment and 39 who had previously been treated for recurrent cysts. Intervention was performed by applying 200 Gy to the internal cyst wall (median volume 6.1 ml). Median clinical and radiological follow-up were 60.2 and 53.0 months, respectively. Actuarial tumor cyst control was 86.0 ± 5.3 \% at 12, 24, and 60 months. Actuarial out-of-field control (development of new cysts or progression of solid tumor parts) was 90.9 ± 4.3, 84.0 ± 5.6, and 54.5 ± 8.8 \% after 12, 24, and 60 months, respectively. Corresponding actuarial overall progression-free survival was 79.4 ± 6.1, 72.4 ± 6.8, and 45.6 ± 8.7 \% at 12, 24, and 60 months, respectively. Visual function improved for 12 patients (23.5 \%), remained unchanged for 34 patients (66.7 \%), and worsened for five patients (9.8 \%), correlating with tumor progression in each case. Endocrinological deterioration occurred for ten patients (19.6 \%); for nine patients this was a result of tumor progression or after tumor resection and for one it was attributed to irradiation. Within six months of IBT seven patients (13.7 \%) experienced transient neurological deficits and two patients (3.9 \%) deteriorated permanently (hemiparesis and third nerve palsy). Stereotactically applied (32)P is highly efficacious for control of cystic components of craniopharyngiomas and is associated with a low risk of permanent morbidity. The procedure does not, however affect the development of new cysts or the progression of solid tumor parts.},

Along the optic axis, the spot size was reduced by up to 6 times beyond the diffraction barrier. The simultaneous 2-fold improvement in the radial direction rendered a nearly spherical fluorescence spot with a diameter of 90-110 nm. The spot volume of down to 0.67 attoliters is 18 times smaller than that of confocal microscopy, thus making our results also relevant to three-dimensional photochemistry and single molecule spectroscopy.

  Abstract                 = {Cell migration is crucial for processes such as immune defense, wound healing, or the formation of tumor metastases. Typically, migrating cells are polarized within the plane of movement with lamellipodium and cell body representing the front and rear of the cell, respectively. Here, we address the question of whether this polarization also extends to the distribution of ion transporters such as Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE) and anion exchanger in the plasma membrane of migrating cells. Both transporters are required for locomotion of renal epithelial (Madin-Darby canine kidney, MDCK-F) cells and human melanoma cells since their blockade reduces the rate of migration in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of migration of MDCK-F cells by NHE blockers is accompanied by a decrease of pH(i). However, when cells are acidified with weak organic acids, migration of MDCK-F cells is normal despite an even more pronounced decrease of pH(i). Under these conditions, NHE activity is increased so that cells are swelling due to the accumulation of organic anions and Na(+). When exclusively applied to the lamellipodium, blockers of NHE or anion exchange inhibit migration of MDCK-F cells as effectively as when applied to the entire cell surface. When they are directed to the cell body, migration is not affected. These data are confirmed immunocytochemically in that the anion exchanger AE2 is concentrated at the front of MDCK-F cells. Our findings show that NHE and anion exchanger are distributed in a polarized way in migrating cells. They are consistent with important contributions of both transporters to protrusion of the lamellipodium via solute uptake and consequent volume increase at the front of migrating cells.},

  Abstract                 = {One grand challenge in current biology is to understand how individual cellular molecules interact together to form a functioning living cell. This requires new methods to image a live cell on the nanoscale. The scanned nanopipette can be used to obtain high resolution noncontact images of the surface of live cells under physiological conditions and has been used to develop a family of related methods that allow mapping of cell function on the nanoscale, and hence allow the relationship between cell structure and function to be probed. This is a powerful method to bridge the current gap between high resolution structures of individual molecular complexes and low resolution imaging of live cell structure and function.},

The microscope uses a modular design where the laser, cantilever/sample holder, reflecting minor, and detector are mounted directly on an optical table. The laser, reflecting mirror, and detector are mounted on translation and rotation stages. With this design the components can be rearranged to calibrate the Z piezo motion as a function of applied voltage. Using the detector micrometers, the detector response (voltage-to-distance relationship) can be determined after each series of measurements. The cantilever/sample holder is constructed such that the components are material matched and thermally compensated from a common reference point. This design feature minimizes thermal drift of the instrument. The instrument can be used in a contact scanning mode where both normal and lateral deflections of the cantilever are measured. In addition, the instrument can be used in frictional force studies, force curve mapping of the surface, and contact potential measurements. We present examples of each, including a detailed account of the instrument design and calibration. (C) 1995 American Institute of Physics.}},

The mechanism of Sema III function, however, is unknown. Here, we report that neuropilin, a type I transmembrane protein implicated in aspects of neurodevelopment, is a Sema III receptor. We also describe the identification of neuropilin-2, a related neuropilin family member, and show that neuropilin and neuropilin-2 are expressed in overlapping, yet distinct, populations of neurons in the rat embryonic nervous system.},

  Abstract                 = {The real-time observation of cell movement in acute cerebellar slices reveals that granule cells alter their shape concomitantly with changes in the mode and rate of migration as they traverse different cortical layers. Although the origin of local environmental cues responsible for these position-specific changes in migratory behavior remains unclear, several signaling mechanisms involved in controlling granule cell movement have emerged. The onset of one such mechanism is marked by the expression of voltage-gated ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors in postmitotic cells prior to the initiation of their migration. Granule cells start their radial migration after the expression of N-type Ca2+ channels and the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors on the plasmalemmal surface. Blockade of the channel or receptor activity significantly decreases the rate of cell movement, indicating that the activation of these membrane constituents provides an essential signal for the translocation of granule cells. Another signal that controls the rate of cell migration is embedded in the combined amplitude and frequency components of Ca2+ fluctuations in the somata of migrating granule cells. Interestingly, each phase of Ca2+ fluctuation controls a separate phase of saltatory movement in the granule cells: The cells move forward during the phase of transient Ca2+ elevation and remain stationary during the troughs. Consequently, the changes in the amplitude and frequency components of Ca2+ fluctuations directly affect granule cell movement: Reducing the amplitude or frequency of Ca2+ fluctuations slows down the speed of cell movement, while the enhancement of these components accelerates migration. These findings suggest that signaling molecules present in the local cellular milieu encountered on the migratory route control the shape and motility of granule cells by modifying Ca2+ fluctuations in the soma through the activation of specific ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors.},

Optical and electron paramagnetic resonance experiments, including electron nuclear double resonance data, proved conclusively that the photogenerated chromophore exhibiting a band with lambda(max) = 565 nm is an alpha-hydroxy aromatic (ketyl) radical of the polymeric ketone. This reducing species was produced by illumination of either solutions or films, but the radical lifetime extended from minutes in the fluid phase to hours in the solid. Direct evidence is presented that this long-lived chromophore reduces Ag(I), Cu(II), and Au(III) ions in solution. A rate constant of k = 1.4 x 10(3) M(-)(1) s(-)(1) was obtained for the reduction of Ag(+) by the ketyl radical from the post-irradiation formation of Ag crystallites. FTIR results confirmed that the photoprocess yielding polymeric ketyl radicals involves a reaction between the macromolecules.

  Abstract                 = {Illumination of air-free aqueous solutions containing sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) and poly(vinyl alcohol) with 350 nm light results in benzophenone ketyl radicals of the polyketone. The polymer radicals form with a quantum yield 0.02 and decay with a second-order rate constant 6 orders of magnitude lower than that of typical alpha-hydroxy radicals. Evidence is presented that the polymeric benzophenone ketyl radicals reduce Ag+, Cu2+, and AuCl4- to metal particles of nanometer dimensions. Decreases in the reduction rates with increasing Ag(I), Cu(II), and Au(III) concentrations are explained using a kinetic model in which the metal ions quench the excited state of the polymeric benzophenone groups, which forms the macromolecular radicals. Quenching is fastest for Ag+, whereas Cu2+ and AuCl4- exhibit similar rate constants. Particle formation becomes more complex as the number of equivalents needed to reduce the metal ions increases; the Au(III) system is an extreme case where the radical reactions operate in parallel with secondary light-initiated and thermal reduction channels. For each metal ion, the polymer-initiated photoreactions produce crystallites possessing distinct properties, such as a very strong plasmon in the Ag case or the narrow size distribution exhibited by Au particles.},

Here we offer an additional mechanism that arises from changes in ionization of fixed charges within, or at the mouth of, a channel or pore. Our hypothesis, which is based on measurements of ion selectivity alongside ion current, applies to pores through some synthetic membranes and through channels-such as those created by certain toxins-that remain (at least partially) open in the low conductance state. It may also explain the phenomena of "open channel noise" and "substate behavior" that characterize several endogenous ion channels and should be considered when modeling the behavior of such channels.},

A key feature of the instrument is its scanning algorithm, which maintains the working distance between the probe and the sample such that they do not make direct physical contact with each other. Numerical simulation of the probe/sample interaction, which closely matches the experimental observations, provides the optimum working distance. The microscope scans highly convoluted surface structures without damaging them and reveals the true topography of cell surfaces. The images resemble those produced by scanning electron microscopy, with the significant difference that the cells remain viable and active. The instrument can monitor small-scale dynamics of cell surfaces as well as whole-cell movement.},

Pneumolysin-induced channels exhibit a wide range of single channel conductances (less than 50 pS to greater than 1 nS at 0.1 M KCl). Channels can be categorized on the basis of their K+:Cl- selectivity: the smallest channels are strongly cation selective, with t+ (the cation transference number) approaching 1.0; the largest channels are unselective (t+ approximately 0.5). Channels tend to remain open at all voltages (-150 to 150 mV); only the smallest channels exhibit any rectification. In the presence of divalent cations (1-5 mM Zn2+; 10-20 mM Ca2+), small (less than 50 pS) and medium-sized (50 pS to 1 nS) channels are closed in a voltage-dependent manner (more closure at higher voltages); at 0 voltage channels reopen. Overall selectivity is reduced by divalent cations, compatible with small, selective channels being closed preferentially to large, nonselective ones. It is concluded that a single molecular species (pneumolysin) induces multiple-sized channels that can be categorized by cation:anion selectivity and by their sensitivity to closure by divalent cations.},

  Abstract                 = {Pneumolysin is one of the family of thiol-activatable, cytolytic toxins. Within these toxins the amino acid sequence Trp-Glu-Trp-Trp is conserved. Mutations made in this region of pneumolysin, residues 433-436 inclusive, did not affect cell binding or the formation of toxin oligomers in the target cell membrane. However, the mutations did affect haemolysis, leakage of low-molecular-mass metabolites from Lettre cells and the induction of conductance channels across planar lipid bilayers. Of eight modified pneumolysins examined, Trp-433-->Phe showed the smallest amount of haemolysis or leakage (less than 5\% of wild type). Pneumolysin-induced leakage from Lettre cells was sensitive to inhibition by bivalent cations but the extent of inhibition varied depending on the modification. Leakage by the mutant Trp-433-->Phe was least sensitive to cation inhibition. The ion-conducting channels formed across planar lipid bilayers exhibit small (less than 30 pS), medium (30 pS-1 nS) and large (more than 1 nS) conductance steps. Small- and medium-sized channels were preferentially closed by bivalent cations. In contrast with wild-type toxin, which formed predominantly small channels, the modified toxin Trp-433-->Phe formed large channels that were insensitive to cation-induced closure. Polysaccharides of molecular mass more than 15 kDa inhibited haemolysis by wild-type toxin, but polysaccharide of up to 40 kDa did not prevent haemolysis by Trp-433-->Phe. Electron microscopy revealed that Trp-433-->Phe formed oligomeric arc and ring structures with dimensions identical with those of wild-type toxin, and that the ratio of arcs to rings formed was the same for wild-type toxin and the Trp-433-->Phe variant. We conclude that the change Trp-433-->Phe affects channel formation at a point subsequent to binding to the cell membrane and the formation of oligomers, and that the size of arc and ring structures revealed by electron microscopy does not reflect the functional state of the channels.},

The technique allows quantitative, high-resolution characterization of the cell surface and the simultaneous recording of topographic and optical images. A particular feature of the method is a reliable mechanism to control the distance between the probe and the sample in physiological buffer. We demonstrate this new method by recording near-field images of living cells (cardiac myocytes).},

Our study attempts to clarify the chronological expression of VEGF and its receptor (flt) system in experimental cerebral infarction.With the use of a reproducible middle cerebral artery occlusion model in rats, VEGF expression was identified by Western blotting with anti-VEGF antibody. The chronological expression of the VEGF/flt system was analyzed semiquantitatively by immunohistochemical means in infarcts with different time courses from 3 hours to 3 weeks.VEGF and flt were expressed exclusively in the ischemic brain. The bands obtained on the immunoblot at 38 and 45 kD are related to those of VEGF121 and VEGF165 isoforms. Macrophages, neurons, and glial cells chronologically expressed VEGF immunoreactivity in a different fashion. Both VEGF (bound) and flt were detected in endothelial cells along with the development of angiogenesis.In the ischemic brain the macrophages, neurons, and glial cells appear to contain VEGF. The VEGF receptor flt was induced in endothelial cells along with the progression of angiogenesis in infarct. The VEGF/flt system is thus considered to be involved in the healing process of brain infarct.},

With the use of TEM, X-ray diffraction, and N2 adsorption, it was shown that the initial hexagonal structure, the high specific surface area, and porosity are retained in the functionalized materials but are not as good as in the starting materials. 1H MAS NMR and 31P MAS NMR revealed that the surface of Si-MCM-41(P) consists of silicon phosphate and pyrophosphate species. That of Ti-MCM-41(P) additionally contains titanium dihydro-, hydro-, and pyrophosphate species, the latter being predominant. TPD of adsorbed ammonia for Si-MCM-41(P) and Ti-MCM-41(P) showed that functionalization leads to the creation of moderate and strong acid sites. A combination of mesoporous structure with acidic properties makes the MCM-41 functionalized with phosphate groups promising for use as solid acid catalysts.},

  Abstract                 = {Many conventional microscopy techniques for investigating platelet morphology such as electron or fluorescence microscopy require highly invasive treatment of the platelets such as fixation, drying and metal coating or staining. Here, we present two unique but entirely different microscopy techniques for direct morphology analysis of live, unstained platelets: scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) and robotic dark-field microscopy (RDM). We demonstrate that both techniques allow for a quantitative evaluation of the morphological features of live adherent platelets. We show that their morphology can be quantified by both techniques using the same geometric parameters and therefore can be directly compared. By imaging the same identical platelets subsequently with SICM and RDM, we found that area, perimeter and circularity of the platelets are directly correlated between SICM and dark-field microscopy (DM), while the fractal dimension (FD) differed between the two microscopy techniques. We show that SICM and RDM are both valuable tools for the ex vivo investigation of the morphology of live platelets, which might contribute to new insights into the physiological and pathophysiological role of platelet spreading.},

  Abstract                 = {Significant angiogenesis occurs only after injury in the adult mammalian brain; capillaries proliferate and astrocytes are activated by presently unresolved cellular mechanisms. Because of the intimate relationship between astrocytes and brain capillaries we examined the expression of the specific endothelial mitogen vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in reactive astrocytes following CNS trauma models: neural grafting, stab wounds, and glioma implantation. In situ hybridization was combined with GFAP immunohistochemistry to delineate VEGF mRNA expression in reactive astrocytes. In addition, VEGF and its receptor flt-1 protein expression were detected immunohistochemically. In all three models we found unexpectedly that only reactive astrocytes, not endothelium, expressed the VEGF receptor flt-1, VEGF mRNA, and VEGF protein in a spatiotemporal manner, suggesting that activated astroglia may have a direct role in the induction of angiogenesis or permeability in mature brain. In addition, secreted VEGF may play a part in astroglial signalling by the induction of its own receptor in reactive astroglia following injury. These findings may have significant implications with regard to growth and reparative mechanisms of the adult cerebrovasculature.},

  Abstract                 = {The movements of E-cadherin, epidermal growth factor receptor, and transferrin receptor in the plasma membrane of a cultured mouse keratinocyte cell line were studied using both single particle tracking (SPT; nanovid microscopy) and fluorescence photobleaching recovery (FPR). In the SPT technique, the receptor molecules are labeled with 40 nm-phi colloidal gold particles, and their movements are followed by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy at a temporal resolution of 33 ms and at a nanometer-level spatial precision. The trajectories of the receptor molecules obtained by SPT were analyzed by developing a method that is based on the plot of the mean-square displacement against time. Four characteristic types of motion were observed: (a) stationary mode, in which the microscopic diffusion coefficient is less than 4.6 x 10(-12) cm2/s; (b) simple Brownian diffusion mode; (c) directed diffusion mode, in which unidirectional movements are superimposed on random motion; and (d) confined diffusion mode, in which particles undergoing Brownian diffusion (microscopic diffusion coefficient between 4.6 x 10(-12) and 1 x 10(-9) cm2/s) are confined within a limited area, probably by the membrane-associated cytoskeleton network. Comparison of these data obtained by SPT with those obtained by FPR suggests that the plasma membrane is compartmentalized into many small domains 300-600 nm in diameter (0.04-0.24 microns2 in area), in which receptor molecules are confined in the time scale of 3-30 s, and that the long-range diffusion observed by FPR can occur by successive movements of the receptors to adjacent compartments. Calcium-induced differentiation decreases the sum of the percentages of molecules in the directed diffusion and the stationary modes outside of the cell-cell contact regions on the cell surface (which is proposed to be the percentage of E-cadherin bound to the cytoskeleton/membrane-skeleton), from approximately 60\% to 8\% (low- and high-calcium mediums, respectively).},

  Abstract                 = {The motility of cells crawling on a substratum has its origin in a thin cell organ called lamella. We present a 2-dimensional continuum model for the lamella dynamics of a slowly migrating cell, such as a human keratinocyte. The central components of the model are the dynamics of a viscous cytoskeleton capable to produce contractile and swelling stresses, and the formation of adhesive bonds in the plasma cell membrane between the lamella cytoskeleton and adhesion sites at the substratum. We will demonstrate that a simple mechanistic model, neglecting the complicated signaling pathways and regulation processes of a living cell, is able to capture the most prominent aspects of the lamella dynamics, such as quasi-periodic protrusions and retractions of the moving tip, retrograde flow of the cytoskeleton and the related accumulation of focal adhesion complexes in the leading edge of a migrating cell. The developed modeling framework consists of a nonlinearly coupled system of hyperbolic, parabolic and ordinary differential equations for the various molecular concentrations, two elliptic equations for cytoskeleton velocity and hydrodynamic pressure in a highly viscous two-phase flow, with appropriate boundary conditions including equalities and inequalities at the moving boundary. In order to analyse this hybrid continuum model by numerical simulations for different biophysical scenarios, we use suitable finite element and finite volume schemes on a fixed triangulation in combination with an adaptive level set method describing the free boundary dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {The quest for nonoptical imaging methods that can surmount light diffraction limits resulted in the development of scanning probe microscopes. However, most of the existing methods are not quite suitable for studying biological samples. The scanning ion conductance microscope (SICM) bridges the gap between the resolution capabilities of atomic force microscope and scanning electron microscope and functional capabilities of conventional light microscope. A nanopipette mounted on a three-axis piezo-actuator, scans a sample of interest and ion current is measured between the pipette tip and the sample. The feedback control system always keeps a certain distance between the sample and the pipette so the pipette never touches the sample. At the same time pipette movement is recorded and this generates a three-dimensional topographical image of the sample surface. SICM represents an alternative to conventional high-resolution microscopy, especially in imaging topography of live biological samples. In addition, the nanopipette probe provides a host of added modalities, for example using the same pipette and feedback control for efficient approach and seal with the cell membrane for ion channel recording. SICM can be combined in one instrument with optical and fluorescent methods and allows drawing structure-function correlations. It can also be used for precise mechanical force measurements as well as vehicle to apply pressure with precision. This can be done on living cells and tissues for prolonged periods of time without them loosing viability. The SICM is a multifunctional instrument, and it is maturing rapidly and will open even more possibilities in the near future.},

  Abstract                 = {Several factors can influence the development of axons and dendrites in vitro. Some of these factors modify the adhesion of neurons to their substratum. We have previously shown that the threshold of neuron-substratum adhesion necessary for initiation and elongation of dendrites is higher than that required for axonal growth. To explain this difference we propose that, in order to antagonize actin-driven surface tension, axons primarily rely on the compression forces of microtubules whereas dendrites rely on adhesion. This model was tested by seeding the cells in conditions allowing the development either of axons or of axons and dendrites, then adding cytochalasin B or nocodazole 1 hour or 24 hours after plating. The addition of cytochalasin B, which depolymerizes actin filaments and thus reduces actin-tensile forces, increases the length of both axons and dendrites, indicating that both axons and dendrites have to antagonize surface tension in order to elongate. The addition of nocodazole, which acts primarily on microtubules, slightly reduces dendrite elongation and totally abolishes axonal growth. Similar results are obtained when the drugs are added 1 or 24 hours after plating, suggesting that the same mechanisms are at work both in initiation and in elongation. Finally, we find that in the presence of cytochalasin B axons adopt a curly morphology, a fact that could be explained by the importance of tensile forces in antagonizing the asymmetry created by polarized microtubules presenting a uniform minus/plus orientation.},

Images of immunofluorescent DRG growth cones colabeled for actin and tubulin were superimposed to images obtained with AFM at different scanning forces. In order to reduce changes of the image surface caused by the pressure of the AFM tip, we have developed a procedure to obtain 0pN AFM images. Further analysis of these images revealed topographical structures with nanoscale dimensions, referred to as "invaginations" or "holes". These holes had an area varying from 0.01 to 3.5 microm(2) with a depth varying from 2 to 178 nm. Comparative analysis with LSCM images showed that these holes correspond to regions where staining of both actin and tubulin was negligible. Filopodia height varied from 40 to 270 nm and their diameter from 113 to 887 nm. These results show that the combination of LSCM and AFM reveal structural details with a nanoscale dimension of DRG growth cones, difficult to resolve with conventional microscopy.},

  Abstract                 = {Activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) by VEGF leads to the activation of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)2/p38 and then to actin polymerization and reorganization into stress fibers in endothelial cells. In turn, this triggers endothelial cell migration. Yet, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms that couple VEGFR2 to SAPK2/p38. Here, we found that VEGF increased by twofold the activity of the small GTPase Cdc42 and that the expression of two different constitutively active forms of Cdc42 (Cdc42 V12 and Cdc42 L61) led to a marked increase in the formation of stress fibers that was sensitive to SAPK2/p38 inhibition by SB203580. Moreover, the expression of a dominant-negative form of Cdc42 (Cdc42 N17) inhibited the activation of SAPK2/p38 and of its direct target MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2. These results indicate that Cdc42 is upstream of SAPK2/p38 in response to the activation of VEGFR2 by VEGF. In contrast, we found that neither RhoA nor Rac was involved in the SAPK2/p38-mediated actin reorganization induced by VEGF. Using a site-specific mutant of the major autophosphorylation site Y1214 on VEGFR2, we found that the mutant Y1214F inhibited the activation of both Cdc42 and SAPK2/p38 in response to VEGF. We conclude that phosphorylation of Y1214 on VEGFR2 is required to trigger the sequential activation of Cdc42 and SAPK2/p38 and to drive the SAPK2/p38-mediated actin remodeling in stress fibers in endothelial cells exposed to VEGF.},

  Abstract                 = {To survive, cells have to avoid excessive alterations of cell volume that jeopardize structural integrity and constancy of intracellular milieu. The function of cellular proteins seems specifically sensitive to dilution and concentration, determining the extent of macromolecular crowding. Even at constant extracellular osmolarity, volume constancy of any mammalian cell is permanently challenged by transport of osmotically active substances across the cell membrane and formation or disappearance of cellular osmolarity by metabolism. Thus cell volume constancy requires the continued operation of cell volume regulatory mechanisms, including ion transport across the cell membrane as well as accumulation or disposal of organic osmolytes and metabolites. The various cell volume regulatory mechanisms are triggered by a multitude of intracellular signaling events including alterations of cell membrane potential and of intracellular ion composition, various second messenger cascades, phosphorylation of diverse target proteins, and altered gene expression. Hormones and mediators have been shown to exploit the volume regulatory machinery to exert their effects. Thus cell volume may be considered a second message in the transmission of hormonal signals. Accordingly, alterations of cell volume and volume regulatory mechanisms participate in a wide variety of cellular functions including epithelial transport, metabolism, excitation, hormone release, migration, cell proliferation, and cell death.},

  Abstract                 = {To survive, cells have to avoid excessive alterations of their volume. To this end, cells have developed a complex machinery of cell volume regulatory mechanisms comprising transport across the cell membrane and metabolism. Upon cell swelling, they loose electrolytes mainly via selective K+ channels and unselective ion channels and/or KCl symport, upon cell shrinkage they accumulate ions by Na+,K+,2Cl- cotransport and parallel operation of Na+/H+ exchange and Cl-/HCO3- exchange. In addition, cell shrinkage stimulates glycogenolysis, proteolysis and formation of organic osmolytes such as amino acids, methylamines and polyols. Cell swelling stimulates formation of glycogen and proteins and cellular release of organic osmolytes. Alterations of cell volume do play a crucial role in the regulation of cell function, as illustrated by four examples: 1. Epithelial transport may lead to cell swelling, which then triggers volume regulatory mechanisms modifying transcellular transport. 2. Insulin swells hepatocytes by activation of Na+,K+,2Cl- cotransport and Na+/H+ exchange, glucagon shrinks those cells by activation of ion channels. The respective volume changes participate in the regulation of cellular protein and glycogen metabolism by these hormones. 3. Growth factors and expression of ras oncogene activate Na+,K+,2Cl- cotransport and Na+/H+ exchange, leading to the respective cell swelling. 4.

  Abstract                 = {We propose a modification of a scanning ion conductance microscope suitable for probing an electrode in an operating electrochemical cell. We demonstrate its use by measuring salt concentration variations near a conducting polymer electrode as the polymer is electrochemically oxidized and reduced. The electrochemical control circuit is opened to isolate the working electrode, at a frequency sufficiently high that the electrode capacitance maintains the electrode potential. The local solution conductivity variations are detected through the probe current during the open-circuit time. We demonstrate two-stage ion exchange during oxidation and reduction of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) films that develops strongly with repeated cycling and is correlated with actuation changes. Spatial composition variations of the film, caused by redox current distribution over the surface, and electromigration to the probe tip, causing local solution composition changes, have clear and characteristic effects on the measured transients.},

  Abstract                 = {Intracellular calcium regulates many of the molecular processes that are essential for cell movement. It is required for the production of actomyosin-based contractile forces, the regulation of the structure and dynamics of the actin cytoskeletons, and the formation and disassembly of cell-substratum adhesions. Calcium also serves as a second messenger in many biochemical signal-transduction pathways. However, despite the pivotal role of calcium in motile processes, it is not clear how calcium regulates overall cell movement. Here we show that transient increases in intracellular calcium, [Ca2+]i, during the locomotion of fish epithelial keratocytes, occur more frequently in cells that become temporarily 'stuck' to the substratum or when subjected to mechanical stretching. We find that calcium transients arise from the activation of stretch-activated calcium channels, which triggers an influx of extracellular calcium. In addition, the subsequent increase in [Ca2+]i is involved in detachment of the rear cell margin. Thus, we have defined a mechanism by which cells can detect and transduce mechanical forces into biochemical signals that can modulate locomotion.},

  Abstract                 = {Upon reduction of particle size to the nanometer range, one has to deal with the general issue of spontaneous agglomeration, which often obstructs postsynthesis modification of nanoparticle surfaces. A technique to cope with this phenomenon is required to realize a wide variety of applications using nanoparticles in solvents or as refined assemblies. In this article, we report on a new technique to facilitate surface chemistry of nanoparticles in a conventional glassware system. A beads-assisted sonication (BASD) process was examined to break up persistent agglomerates of nanodiamonds in two different reactions for simultaneous surface functionalization. The chosen reactions are the silanization with an acrylate-modified silane and the arylation using diazonium salts. The BASD process can be successfully applied even where the original material is not dispersible in the reaction solvent at all, as the formation of ever smaller, increasingly functionalized agglomerates is improving their solubility. We have confirmed that the presence of ceramic beads enables functionalization of each primary particle, while conventional magnetic stirring or beadless sonication can reach primary particles only when agglomeration is loose. Additionally, mechanical surface modification of nanodiamond was found to take place by BASD with high energy density, leading to sp(2)-hybridized surface patches on nanodiamond. This allowed for the efficient grafting of aryl groups to the surface of primary diamond nanoparticles. Stable, homogeneously functionalized nanodiamond particles in colloidal solution can be obtained by this method.},

  Abstract                 = {Surface-modified carboxylated nanometre-sized diamond (cND) has been applied for the conjugation of biological molecules such as DNA and protein. In this study, we evaluated the biocompatibility and detection of cNDs and carbon nanotubes on human lung A549 epithelial cells and HFL-1 normal fibroblasts. Treatment with 5 or 100 nm cND particles, 0.1–100 µg ml −1 , did not reduce the cell viability and alter the protein expression profile in lung cells; however, carbon nanotubes induced cytotoxicity in these cells. The cNDs particles were accumulated in A549 cells, which were observed by atomic force microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy. Both 5 and 100 nm cNDs particles exhibited the green fluorescence and were ingested into cells. Moreover, the fluorescence intensities were increased in cells via a concentration-dependent manner after treatment with 5 and 100 nm cNDs, which can be detected by flow cytometer analysis. The fluorescence intensities of 5 nm cNDs were relative higher than 100 nm cNDs in cells at equal concentration treatment. The observation demonstrated that cND-interacting with cell is detectable by a confocal microscope, flow cytometer and atomic force microscope. These nanoparticles may be useful for further biomedical applications based on the properties of uptake ability, detectability and little cytotoxicity in human cells.},

However, high-resolution characterization of their morphology has not been addressed by conventional microscopy. Under the help of high-resolution hopping probe ion conductance microscopy, we demonstrated that three morphologically distinct cell populations exist in live NB SK-N-SH cell line. Among these three types cells, N-type cells had the smallest cell volume and the biggest height, S-type owned the biggest cell volume and the smallest height, and I-type was intermediate between N- and S-type. The difference of microvilli morphology rendered I- and N-type cells with a higher RMS than S-type cells. These high-resolution morphologic criteria can provide more direct information to distinguish different cell types in NB tumor, and may give a hand to the development of new therapies and diagnosis.},

For motility, lamellipodium extension and stabilization are prerequisites, but how cells form such membrane protrusions is still obscure. Using contrast-enhanced video microscopy and Transwell assays, we show that water-selective aquaporin channels regulate lamellipodium formation and neutrophil motility. Addition of anti-aquaporin-9 antibodies, HgCl(2), or tetraethyl ammonium inhibited the function(s) of the channels and blocked motility-related shape changes. On human neutrophils, aquaporin-9 preferentially localized to the cell edges, where N-formyl peptide receptors also accumulated, as assessed with fluorescence microscopy. To directly visualize water fluxes at cell edges, cells were loaded with high dilution-sensitive, self-quenching concentrations of fluorophore. In these cells, motile regions always displayed increased fluorescence compared with perinuclear regions. Our observations provide the first experimental support for motility models where water fluxes play a pivotal role in cell-volume increases accompanying membrane extensions.},

The protein tag (HaloTag) is a modified haloalkane dehalogenase designed to covalently bind to synthetic ligands (HaloTag ligands). The synthetic ligands comprise a chloroalkane linker attached to a variety of useful molecules, such as fluorescent dyes, affinity handles, or solid surfaces. Covalent bond formation between the protein tag and the chloroalkane linker is highly specific, occurs rapidly under physiological conditions, and is essentially irreversible. We demonstrate the utility of this system for cellular imaging and protein immobilization by analyzing multiple molecular processes associated with NF-kappaB-mediated cellular physiology, including imaging of subcellular protein translocation and capture of protein--protein and protein--DNA complexes.},

Importantly, its high permeability and fluorogenic character permit the imaging of proteins in living cells and tissues, and its brightness and photostability make it ideally suited for live-cell super-resolution microscopy. The excellent spectroscopic properties of the probe combined with its ease of use in live-cell applications make it a powerful new tool for bioimaging.},

  Abstract                 = {T-tubular invaginations of the sarcolemma of ventricular cardiomyocytes contain junctional structures functionally coupling L-type calcium channels to the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-release channels (the ryanodine receptors), and therefore their configuration controls the gain of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR). Studies primarily in rodent myocardium have shown the importance of T-tubular structures for calcium transient kinetics and have linked T-tubule disruption to delayed CICR. However, there is disagreement as to the nature of T-tubule changes in human heart failure. We studied isolated ventricular myocytes from patients with ischemic heart disease, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and determined T-tubule structure with either the fluorescent membrane dye di-8-ANNEPs or the scanning ion conductance microscope (SICM). The SICM uses a scanning pipette to produce a topographic representation of the surface of the live cell by a non-optical method. We have also compared ventricular myocytes from a rat model of chronic heart failure after myocardial infarction. T-tubule loss, shown by both ANNEPs staining and SICM imaging, was pronounced in human myocytes from all etiologies of disease. SICM imaging showed additional changes in surface structure, with flattening and loss of Z-groove definition common to all etiologies. Rat myocytes from the chronic heart failure model also showed both T-tubule and Z-groove loss, as well as increased spark frequency and greater spark amplitude. This study confirms the loss of T-tubules as part of the phenotypic change in the failing human myocyte, but it also shows that this is part of a wider spectrum of alterations in surface morphology.},

  Abstract                 = {Background- Cardiomyocyte surface morphology and T-tubular structure are significantly disrupted in chronic heart failure, with important functional sequelae, including redistribution of sarcolemmal β(2)-adrenergic receptors (β(2)AR) and localized secondary messenger signaling. Plasticity of these changes in the reverse remodeled failing ventricle is unknown. We used AAV9.SERCA2a gene therapy to rescue failing rat hearts and measured z-groove index, T-tubule density, and compartmentalized β(2)AR-mediated cAMP signals, using a combined nanoscale scanning ion conductance microscopy-Förster resonance energy transfer technique. Methods and Results- Cardiomyocyte surface morphology, quantified by z-groove index and T-tubule density, was normalized in reverse-remodeled hearts after SERCA2a gene therapy. Recovery of sarcolemmal microstructure correlated with functional β(2)AR redistribution back into the z-groove and T-tubular network, whereas minimal cAMP responses were initiated after local β(2)AR stimulation of crest membrane, as observed in failing cardiomyocytes. Improvement of β(2)AR localization was associated with recovery of βAR-stimulated contractile responses in rescued cardiomyocytes. Retubulation was associated with reduced spatial heterogeneity of electrically stimulated calcium transients and recovery of myocardial BIN-1 and TCAP protein expression but not junctophilin-2. Conclusions- In summary, abnormalities of sarcolemmal structure in heart failure show plasticity with reappearance of z-grooves and T-tubules in reverse-remodeled hearts. Recovery of surface topology is necessary for normalization of β(2)AR location and signaling responses.},

  Abstract                 = {The coupling mechanism between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium ion (Ca2+) stores and plasma membrane (PM) store-operated channels (SOCs) is crucial to Ca2+ signaling but has eluded detection. SOCs may be functionally related to the TRP family of receptor-operated channels. Direct comparison of endogenous SOCs with stably expressed TRP3 channels in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells revealed that TRP3 channels differ in being store independent. However, condensed cortical F-actin prevented activation of both SOC and TRP3 channels, which suggests that ER-PM interactions underlie coupling of both channels. A cell-permeant inhibitor of inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) function, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, prevented both receptor-induced TRP3 activation and store-induced SOC activation. It is concluded that InsP3Rs mediate both SOC and TRP channel opening and that the InsP3R is essential for maintaining coupling between store emptying and physiological activation of SOCs.},

We sought to understand how the dynamic behavior of the actin cytoskeleton is regulated to produce extension or retraction. By observing the movement of fiduciary marks on actin filaments in growth cones of a neuroblastoma cell line, we found that filopodium extension and retraction are governed by a balance between the rate of actin cytoskeleton assembly at the tip and retrograde flow. Both assembly and flow rate can vary with time in a single filopodium and between filopodia in a single growth cone. Regulation of assembly rate is the dominant factor in controlling filopodia behavior in our system.},

Neutrophils migrating through the extracellular matrix in vivo encounter these and other substrates in a three-dimensional architecture that may alter the spatial distribution of adhesion receptors in contact with the matrix. In this study, we used fluorescence confocal microscopy to obtain moving three-dimensional images of neutrophils migrating through a biological tissue (human amnion) in the presence and absence of [Ca2+]i-buffering with quin2. In the absence of buffering, [Ca2+]i transients similar to those seen in cells migrating in two-dimensions were observed. [Ca2+]i-buffered neutrophils were able to migrate into the matrix, but they became attached firmly to the substrate at the rear of the cell, resulting in a drastically elongated morphology. Immunofluorescence revealed that neutrophils adhered to regions of the matrix that contained fibronectin. RGD-containing peptides and antibodies that block integrin adhesion receptors for fibronectin and vitronectin were able to rescue the migration of quin2-treated cells through three-dimensional gels containing fibronectin and vitronectin. These data show that neutrophils migrating through physiologically relevant, three-dimensional matrices undergo repetitive increases in [Ca2+]i that are required for integrin-mediated detachment from the matrix.},

This process, called chemotaxis, is essential for immune system function and homeostasis, and its deregulation is associated with serious diseases. Chemotaxis is initiated by chemoattractant binding to heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors, which translate the gradients into accurate directional migration. A necessary step in this process is cell polarization, the acquisition of functional and spatial asymmetry. The use of new imaging technologies enables analysis of spatial and temporal changes in the activity of proteins and membrane domains involved in polarization and chemotaxis. We discuss the sometimes contradictory evidence available and the emerging molecular model for immune cell polarity and chemotaxis.},

  Abstract                 = {Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) takes advantage of the increase in the resistance which occurs if a glass microelectrode is closely approached to a poorly conducting membrane (Science 243 (1989) 641) and has been shown to be a promising technique to study membranes of living cells (Biophys J 73 (1997a) 653; J Microsc 188 (1997b) 17). Based on a newly designed set-up on top of an inverted light microscope in combination with a speed optimized low noise intracellular amplifier, a novel mode for control of the distance between the probe and surface has been developed. By application of current pulses, the change in the resistance is monitored independently from electrode drift and parasitic DC currents. We demonstrate the applicability by showing first high-resolution images of neural cells produced with the pulse-mode operated SICM.},

  Abstract                 = {Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a frequent complication of preterm delivery. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) released from astrocytes and microglia activated by infection or ischemia have previously been shown to impair survival and maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitors and could thus be considered as potential factors contributing to the generation of this disease. The first goal of the present study was to investigate whether exposure of oligodendrocyte precursors to these cytokines arrests the maturation of ion currents in parallel to its effects on myelin proteins and morphological maturation. Secondly, in the search for agents, that can protect differentiating oligodendrocyte precursor cells from cytokine-induced damage we investigated effects of coapplications of corticosteroids with proinflammatory cytokines on the subsequent survival and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.To exclude influences from factors released from other cell types purified cultures of oligodendrocyte precursors were exposed to cytokines and/or steroids and allowed to differentiate for further 6 days in culture. Changes in membrane surface were investigated with capacitance recordings and Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy. Na+- and K+- currents were investigated using whole cell patch clamp recordings. The expression of myelin specific proteins was investigated using western blots and the precursor cells were identified using immunostaining with A2B5 antibodies.Surviving IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha treated cells continued to maintain voltage-activated Na+- and K+ currents characteristic for the immature cells after 6 days in differentiation medium. Corticosterone, dihydrocorticosterone and, most prominently dexamethasone, counteracted the deleterious effects of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha on cell survival, A2B5-immunostaining and expression of myelin basic protein. The most potent corticosteroid tested, dexamethasone, was shown to counteract cytokine effects on membrane surface extension and capacitance. Furthermore, coapplication of dexamethasone blocked the cytokine-induced downregulation of the inwardly rectifying potassium current in 80\% of the precursor cells and restored the cytokine-blocked down-regulation of the voltage activated Na+- and K+ currents during subsequent differentiation.Our results show that treatment of oligodendrocyte precursors with the inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma block the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors at the level of the differentiation of the voltage-gated ion currents. Co-treatment with corticosteroids at the time of cytokine application restores to a considerable extent survival and differentiation of oligodendrocytes at the level of morphological, myelin protein as well as ion current maturation suggesting the option for a functional restoration of cytokine-damaged immature oligodendrocytes.},

Both migrated and non-migrated CNE-2Z cells, when swollen by 47\% hypotonic solution, exhibited RVD which was inhibited by extracellular application of chloride channel blockers adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB) and tamoxifen. However, RVD rate in migrated CNE-2Z cells was bigger than that of non-migrated cells and the sensitivity of migrated cells to NPPB and tamoxifen was higher than that of non-migrated cells. ATP, NPPB and tamoxifen also inhibited migration of CNE-2Z cells. The inhibition of migration was positively correlated to the blockage of RVD, with a correlation coefficient (r) = 0.99, suggesting a functional relationship between RVD and cell migration. We conclude that RVD is involved in cell migration and RVD may play an important role in migratory process in CNE-2Z cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Neuronal migration is, along with axon guidance, one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the wiring of the brain. As other organs, the nervous system has acquired the ability to grow both in size and complexity by using migration as a strategy to position cell types from different origins into specific coordinates, allowing for the generation of brain circuitries. Guidance of migrating neurons shares many features with axon guidance, from the use of substrates to the specific cues regulating chemotaxis. There are, however, important differences in the cell biology of these two processes. The most evident case is nucleokinesis, which is an essential component of migration that needs to be integrated within the guidance of the cell. Perhaps more surprisingly, the cellular mechanisms underlying the response of the leading process of migrating cells to guidance cues might be different to those involved in growth cone steering, at least for some neuronal populations.},

  Abstract                 = {The sympathetic nervous system, via postganglionic innervation of blood vessels and the heart, is an important determinant of cardiovascular function. The mechanisms underlying sympathetic innervation of targets are not fully understood. This study tests the hypothesis that target-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes sympathetic innervation of blood vessels. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses indicate that VEGF is produced by vascular cells in arteries and that VEGF receptors are expressed on sympathetic nerve fibers innervating arteries. In vitro, exogenously added VEGF and VEGF produced by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in sympathetic neurovascular cocultures inhibited semaphorin 3A (Sema3A)-induced collapse of sympathetic growth cones. In the absence of Sema3A, VEGF and VSMCs also increased growth cone area. These effects were mediated via VEGF receptor 1. In vivo, the neutralization of VEGF inhibited the reinnervation of denervated femoral arteries. These data demonstrate that target-derived VEGF plays a previously unrecognized role in promoting the growth of sympathetic axons.},

  Abstract                 = {Contact-dependent signaling between membrane-linked ligands and receptors such as the ephrins and Eph receptor tyrosine kinases controls a wide range of developmental and pathological processes. Paradoxically, many cell types coexpress both ligands and receptors, raising the question of how specific signaling readouts are achieved under these conditions. Here, we studied the signaling activities exerted by coexpressed EphA receptors and GPI-linked ephrin-A ligands in spinal motor neuron growth cones. We demonstrate that coexpressed Eph and ephrin proteins segregate laterally into distinct membrane domains from which they signal opposing effects on the growth cone: EphAs direct growth cone collapse/repulsion and ephrin-As signal motor axon growth/attraction. This subcellular arrangement of Eph-ephrin proteins enables axons to discriminate between cis- versus trans-configurations of ligand/receptor proteins, thereby allowing the utilization of both Ephs and ephrins as functional guidance receptors within the same neuronal growth cone.},

Time-lapse video recording was used to monitor behaviors of living cells, and cytoskeletal arrangements in neurites were assessed via immunofluorescence and electron microscopic observations of thin sections and whole, detergent-extracted cells decorated with the S1 fragment of myosin. On highly adhesive substrata, nerve cells were observed to extend numerous (though peculiarly oriented) neurites in the presence of cytochalasin, despite their lack of both filopodia and lamellipodia or the orderly actin networks characteristic of typical growth cones. We concluded that growth cone activity is not necessary for neurite elongation, although actin arrays seem important in mediating characteristics of substratum selectivity and neurite shape.},

  Abstract                 = {Proper neural circuitry requires that growth cones, motile tips of extending axons, respond to molecular guidance cues expressed in the developing organism. However, it is unclear how guidance cues modify the cytoskeleton to guide growth cone pathfinding. Here, we show acute treatment with two attractive guidance cues, nerve growth factor (NGF) and netrin-1, for embryonic dorsal root ganglion and temporal retinal neurons, respectively, results in increased growth cone membrane protrusion, actin polymerization, and filamentous actin (F-actin). ADF/cofilin (AC) family proteins facilitate F-actin dynamics, and we found the inactive phosphorylated form of AC is decreased in NGF- or netrin-1-treated growth cones. Directly increasing AC activity mimics addition of NGF or netrin-1 to increase growth cone protrusion and F-actin levels. Extracellular gradients of NGF, netrin-1, and a cell-permeable AC elicit attractive growth cone turning and increased F-actin barbed ends, F-actin accumulation, and active AC in growth cone regions proximal to the gradient source. Reducing AC activity blunts turning responses to NGF and netrin. Our results suggest that gradients of NGF and netrin-1 locally activate AC to promote actin polymerization and subsequent growth cone turning toward the side containing higher AC activity.},

  Abstract                 = {Angiogenic growth factors and their endothelial receptors function as major regulators of blood vessel formation. The VEGF/VEGFR and the Angiopoietin/Tie2 receptor systems represent key signal transduction pathways involved in the regulation of embryonic vascular development. Inactivation of any of the genes encoding these molecules results in defective vascular development and lethality between embryonic day 8.5 and 12.5. In addition, VEGF and its receptors are also critically involved in the regulation of pathological blood vessel growth in the adult during various angiogenesis-dependent diseases that are associated with tissue hypoxia, such as solid tumor growth and ischemic diseases. It is now well established that therapeutic angiogenesis can be achieved in animal models of hind limb and myocardial ischemia by exogenously adding VEGF and/or other angiogenic growth factors. Available clinical data from human trials also suggests that patients with severe cardiovascular diseases could potentially benefit from such therapies. However, much more work needs to be done to compare the potency of different angiogenic factors or the combination thereof, as well as the best way of delivery, either as recombinant proteins, as naked DNA or via adenoviral vectors. Nevertheless, the therapeutic efficacy of simply injecting naked plasmid DNA or proteins into ischemic tissue to deliver secreted angiogenic factors is an encouraging finding. Time will show whether the adverse side effects of therapeutic angiogenesis, mainly vascular permeability and edema formation, can be minimized and angiogenic factors can be used as an effective therapy in patients for the treatment of ischemic diseases such as arterial occlusive disease, myocardial infarction, and, eventually, also stroke.},

  Abstract                 = {The family of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) currently includes VEGF-A, -B, -C, -D, -E, and placenta growth factor (PlGF). Several of these factors, notably VEGF-A, exist as different isoforms, which appear to have unique biological functions. The VEGF family proteins bind in a distinct pattern to three structurally related receptor tyrosine kinases, denoted VEGF receptor-1, -2, and -3. Neuropilins, heparan-sulfated proteoglycans, cadherins, and integrin alphavbeta3 serve as coreceptors for certain but not all VEGF proteins. Moreover, the angiogenic response to VEGF varies between different organs and is dependent on the genetic background of the animal. Inactivation of the genes for VEGF-A and VEGF receptor-2 leads to embryonal death due to the lack of endothelial cells. Inactivation of the gene encoding VEGF receptor-1 leads to an increased number of endothelial cells, which obstruct the vessel lumen. Inactivation of VEGF receptor-3 leads to abnormally organized vessels and cardiac failure. Although VEGF receptor-3 normally is expressed only on lymphatic endothelial cells, it is up-regulated on vascular as well as nonvascular tumors and appears to be involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. A large body of data, such as those on gene inactivation, indicate that VEGF receptor-1 exerts a negative regulatory effect on VEGF receptor-2, at least during embryogenesis. Recent data imply a positive regulatory role for VEGF receptor-1 in pathological angiogenesis. The VEGF proteins are in general poor mitogens, but binding of VEGF-A to VEGF receptor-2 leads to survival, migration, and differentiation of endothelial cells and mediation of vascular permeability. This review outlines the current knowledge about the signal transduction properties of VEGF receptors, with focus on VEGF receptor-2.},

The binding of VEGF-A to VEGFR-2 causes receptor dimerization, kinase activation and autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the dimeric complex. Tyrosine(Y)951 in the kinase-insert domain, Y1054 and Y1059 in the kinase domain and Y1175 and Y1214 in the C-terminal tail have been shown to serve as autophosphorylation sites. Phosphorylated Y1175 creates a binding site for phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLC-gamma1) and Shb. Activation of PLC-gamma1 and Shb regulates VEGF-A-dependent cell proliferation and cell migration, respectively. Phosphorylated Y951 binds and mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of the T-cell-specific adaptor protein (TSAd), which is expressed in endothelial cells. Y951-mediated coupling of VEGFR-2 and TSAd is critical for VEGF-A-induced cell migration and actin reorganization, and for pathological angiogenesis. These phosphorylation sites may be useful targets for the development of anti-angiogenic therapies to treat atherosclerosis and cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {Many cells, including neuronal and glial progenitor cells, stem cells and microglial cells, have the capacity to move through the extracellular spaces of the developing and mature brain. This is particularly pronounced in astrocyte-derived tumors, gliomas, which diffusely infiltrate the normal brain. Although a significant body of literature exists regarding signals that are involved in the guidance of cells and their processes, little attention has been paid to cell-shape and cell-volume changes of migratory cells. However, extracellular spaces in the brain are very narrow and represent a major obstacle that requires cells to dynamically regulate their volume. Recent studies in glioma cells show that this involves the secretion of Cl(-) and K(+) with water. Pharmacological inhibition of Cl(-) channels impairs their ability to migrate and limits tumor progression in experimental tumor models. One Cl(-)-channel inhibitor, chlorotoxin, is currently in Phase II clinical trials to treat malignant glioma. This article reviews our current knowledge of cell-volume changes and the role of ion channels during the migration of glioma cells. It also discusses evidence that supports the importance of channel-mediated cell-volume changes in the migration of immature neurons and progenitor cells during development. New unpublished data is presented, which demonstrates that Cl(-) and K(+) channels involved in cell shrinkage localize to lipid-raft domains on the invadipodia of glioma cells and that their presence might be regulated by trafficking of these proteins in and out of lipid rafts.},

  Abstract                 = {Nanopipets are versatile tools for nanoscience, particularly when used in scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) to determine, in a noncontact manner, the topography of a sample. We present a new method, applying an oscillating bias between a quasi-reference counter electrode (QRCE) in the SICM nanopipet probe and a second QRCE in the bulk solution, to generate a feedback signal to control the distance between the end of a nanopipet and a surface. Both the amplitude and phase of the oscillating ion current, induced by the oscillating bias and extracted using a phase-sensitive detector, are shown to be sensitive to the probe-surface distance and are used to provide stable feedback signals. The phase signal is particularly sensitive at high frequencies of the oscillating bias (up to 30 kHz herein). This development eliminates the need to physically oscillate the probe to generate an oscillating ion current feedback signal, as needed for conventional SICM modes. Moreover, bias modulation allows a feedback signal to be generated without any net ion current flow, ensuring that any polarization of the quasi reference counter electrodes, electro-osmotic effects, and perturbations of the supporting electrolyte composition are minimized. Both feedback signals, magnitude and phase, are analyzed through approach curve measurements to different surfaces at a range of distinct frequencies and via impedance measurements at different distances from a surface. The bias modulated response is readily understood via a simple equivalent circuit model. Bias modulated (BM)-SICM is compared to conventional SICM imaging through measurements of substrates with distinct topographical features and yields equivalent results. Finally, BM-SICM with both amplitude and phase feedback is used for topographical imaging of subtle etch features in a calcite crystal surface. The 2 modes yield similar results, but phase-detection opens up the prospect of faster imaging.},

  abstract    = {Targeted radiotherapies maximize cytotoxicty to cancer cells. In vivo α-generator targeted radiotherapies can deliver multiple α particles to a receptor site dramatically amplifying the radiation dose delivered to the target. The major challenge with α-generator radiotherapies is that traditional chelating moieties are unable to sequester the radioactive daughters in the bioconjugate which is critical to minimize toxicity to healthy, non-target tissue. The recoil energy of the (225)Ac daughters following α decay will sever any metal-ligand bond used to form the bioconjugate. This work demonstrates that an engineered multilayered nanoparticle-antibody conjugate can deliver multiple α radiations and contain the decay daughters of (225)Ac while targeting biologically relevant receptors in a female BALB/c mouse model. These multi-shell nanoparticles combine the radiation resistance of lanthanide phosphate to contain (225)Ac and its radioactive decay daughters, the magnetic properties of gadolinium phosphate for easy separation, and established gold chemistry for attachment of targeting moieties.},

  Abstract                 = {Silicon nitride is a biocompatible material that is currently used as an interfacial surface between cells and large-scale integration devices incorporating ion-sensitive field-effect transistor technology. Here, we investigated whether a poly-L-lysine coated silicon nitride surface is suitable for the culture of PC12 cells, which are widely used as a model for neural differentiation, and we characterized their interaction based on cell behavior when seeded on the tested material. The coated surface was first examined in terms of wettability and topography using contact angle measurements and atomic force microscopy and then, conditioned silicon nitride surface was used as the substrate for the study of PC12 cell culture properties. We found that coating silicon nitride with poly-L-lysine increased surface hydrophilicity and that exposing this coated surface to an extracellular aqueous environment gradually decreased its roughness. When PC12 cells were cultured on a coated silicon nitride surface, adhesion and spreading were facilitated, and the cells showed enhanced morphological differentiation compared to those cultured on a plastic culture dish. A bromodeoxyuridine assay demonstrated that, on the coated silicon nitride surface, higher proportions of cells left the cell cycle, remained in a quiescent state and had longer survival times. Therefore, our study of the interaction of the silicon nitride surface with PC12 cells provides important information for the production of devices that need to have optimal cell culture-supporting properties in order to be used in the study of neuronal functions.},

  Abstract                 = {The dependence of anterograde axoplasmic transport on cytoskeletal components was investigated using microinjection of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the somata of chick dorsal root ganglion cells in vitro. Microinjected HRP was transported anterogradely in the neurites and their branches; this transport was disturbed by colchicine in a drug-dependent and time-dependent manner. Cytochalasin B, a drug that depolymerizes actin, did not inhibit the transport of HRP, despite the formation of local swellings in neurites. The microinjection of polyclonal antibodies directed against tubulin and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against 200-kDa neurofilaments disturbed the axoplasmic transport of co-injected HRP, which then exhibited an irregular and discontinuous distribution in the axonal branches. The transport of HRP became discontinuous after the injection of anti-tubulin antibodies and led to the formation of globular deposits of HRP. Polyclonal antibodies against actin and mAbs to 160-kDa and 68-kDa neurofilaments seemed to have no effect on the axoplasmic transport of co-injected HRP. Microinjection of antibodies against tubulin induced formation of perinuclear bundles consisting of cytoskeletal components. The transport of HRP thus appears to be regulated by an intact microtubular system and cross-linker components (200-kDa neurofilaments) of the cytoskeleton. Actin and most intermediate filament proteins do not seem to play an essential role in the transport of HRP.},

  Abstract                 = {Actin-based motility is critical for nervous system development. Both the migration of neurons and the extension of neurites require organized actin polymerization to push the cell membrane forward. Numerous extracellular stimulants of motility and axon guidance cues regulate actin-based motility through the rho GTPases (rho, rac, and cdc42). The rho GTPases reorganize the actin cytoskeleton, leading to stress fiber, filopodium, or lamellipodium formation. The activity of the rho GTPases is regulated by a variety of proteins that either stimulate GTP uptake (activation) or hydrolysis (inactivation). These proteins potentially link extracellular signals to the activation state of rho GTPases. Effectors downstream of the rho GTPases that directly influence actin polymerization have been identified and are involved in neurite development. The Arp2/3 complex nucleates the formation of new actin branches that extend the membrane forward. Ena/VASP proteins can cause the formation of longer actin filaments, characteristic of growth cone actin morphology, by preventing the capping of barbed ends. Actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin depolymerizes and severs actin branches in older parts of the actin meshwork, freeing monomers to be re-incorporated into actively growing filaments. The signaling mechanisms by which extracellular cues that guide axons to their targets lead to direct effects on actin filament dynamics are becoming better understood.},

  Abstract                 = {Cardiovascular diseases are complex pathologies that include alterations of various cell functions at the levels of intact tissue, single cells and subcellular signalling compartments. Conventional techniques to study these processes are extremely divergent and rely on a combination of individual methods, which usually provide spatially and temporally limited information on single parameters of interest. This review describes scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) as a novel versatile technique capable of simultaneously reporting various structural and functional parameters at nanometre resolution in living cardiovascular cells at the level of the whole tissue, single cells and at the subcellular level, to investigate the mechanisms of cardiovascular disease. SICM is a multimodal imaging technology that allows concurrent and dynamic analysis of membrane morphology and various functional parameters (cell volume, membrane potentials, cellular contraction, single ion-channel currents and some parameters of intracellular signalling) in intact living cardiovascular cells and tissues with nanometre resolution at different levels of organization (tissue, cellular and subcellular levels). Using this technique, we showed that at the tissue level, cell orientation in the inner and outer aortic arch distinguishes atheroprone and atheroprotected regions. At the cellular level, heart failure leads to a pronounced loss of T-tubules in cardiac myocytes accompanied by a reduction in Z-groove ratio. We also demonstrated the capability of SICM to measure the entire cell volume as an index of cellular hypertrophy. This method can be further combined with fluorescence to simultaneously measure cardiomyocyte contraction and intracellular calcium transients or to map subcellular localization of membrane receptors coupled to cyclic adenosine monophosphate production. The SICM pipette can be used for patch-clamp recordings of membrane potential and single channel currents. In conclusion, SICM provides a highly informative multimodal imaging platform for functional analysis of the mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases, which should facilitate identification of novel therapeutic strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a mathematical model that describes key details of actin dynamics in protrusion associated with cell motility. The model is based on the dendritic-nucleation hypothesis for lamellipodial protrusion in nonmuscle cells such as keratocytes. We consider a set of partial differential equations for diffusion and reactions of sequestered actin complexes, nucleation, and growth by polymerization of barbed ends of actin filaments, as well as capping and depolymerization of the filaments. The mechanical aspect of protrusion is based on an elastic polymerization ratchet mechanism. An output of the model is a relationship between the protrusion velocity and the number of filament barbed ends pushing the membrane. Significantly, this relationship has a local maximum: too many barbed ends deplete the available monomer pool, too few are insufficient to generate protrusive force, so motility is stalled at either extreme. Our results suggest that to achieve rapid motility, some tuning of parameters affecting actin dynamics must be operating in the cell.},

Astrocytes are the main cell type in the mammalian brain showing volume perturbations under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. We investigated the involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in hyposmotic medium-induced [3H]taurine and D-[3H]aspartate release from primary astrocyte cultures. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors tyrphostin 23 and tyrphostin A51 partially suppressed the volume-dependent release of [3H]taurine in a dose-dependent manner with half-maximal effects at approximately 40 and 1 microM, respectively. In contrast, the release of D-[3H]aspartate was not significantly affected by these agents in the same concentration range. The inactive analog tyrphostin 1 had no significant effect on the release of both amino acids. The data obtained suggest the existence of at least two volume-dependent anion channels permeable to amino acids in astrocyte cultures. One of these channels is permeable to taurine and is under the control of tyrosine kinase(s). The other is permeable to both taurine and aspartate, but its volume-dependent regulation does not require tyrosine phosphorylation.},

Subsequent insulation of the electrode with parylene results in a hybrid electrode for SECM-SICM measurements. Electrode fabrication is straightforward and highly parallel. For image collection, ionic current measured at the nanopipet both controls the position of the electrode with respect to the membrane surface and reports the local conductance in the vicinity of the nanopipet, while faradaic current measured at the Au electrode reports the presence of redox-active molecules. Application of a transmembrane potential difference affords additional control over migration of charged species across the membrane.},

  Abstract                 = {Ca2+ ions have long been implicated in regulating various aspects of cell movements. We found that stretching forces applied through flexible substrata induced increases in both intracellular Ca2+ concentration and traction forces of NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Conversely, application of gadolinium, an inhibitor of stretch-activated ion channels, or removal of extracellular free Ca2+ caused inhibition of traction forces. Gadolinium treatment also inhibited cell migration without affecting the spread morphology or protrusive activities. Local application of gadolinium to the trailing region had no detectable effect on the overall traction forces, while local application to the leading edge caused a global inhibition of traction forces and cell migration, suggesting that stretch-activated channels function primarily at the leading edge. Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that gadolinium caused a pronounced decrease in vinculin and phosphotyrosine concentrations at focal adhesions. Our observations suggest that stretch-activated Ca2+ entry in the frontal region regulates the organization of focal adhesions and the output of mechanical forces. This mechanism probably plays an important role in sustaining cell migration and in mediating active and passive responses to mechanical signals.},

It has been suggested that such rafts could play an important role in many cellular processes including signal transduction, membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, and pathogen entry. However, rafts have proven difficult to visualize in living cells. Most of the evidence for their existence and function relies on indirect methods such as detergent extraction, and a number of recent studies have revealed possible problems with these methods. Direct studies of the distribution of raft components in living cells have not yet reached a consensus on the size or even the presence of these microdomains, and hence it seems that a definitive proof of raft existence has yet to be obtained.},

  Abstract                 = {Polarization of the motile cell is associated with the formation of a distinct plasma membrane domain, the pseudopod, whose stabilization determines the directionality of cell movement. The rapid movement of cells over a substrate requires that an essential aspect of cell motility must be the supply of the necessary molecular machinery to the site of pseudopodial extension. Renewal of this pseudopodial domain requires the directed delivery to the site of pseudopodial protrusion of proteins which regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell-substrate adhesion, and localized degradation of the extracellular matrix. Polarized targeting mechanisms include the targeted delivery of beta-actin mRNA to the leading edge and microtubule-based vesicular traffic. The latter may include Golgi-derived vesicles of the biosynthetic pathway as well as clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytosis and recycling. Coordination of protrusive activities and supply mechanisms is critical for efficient cellular displacement and may implicate small GTPases of the Rho family. While the specific molecular mechanisms underlying pseudopodial protrusion of the motile cell are well-characterized, discussion of these diverse mechanisms in the context of cellular polarization has been limited.},

  Abstract                 = {Axon outgrowth requires plasma membrane expansion, which results from post-Golgi vesicular transport and fusion. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating post-Golgi vesicular trafficking for membrane expansion and axon outgrowth remain unclear. Here, we show that Rab33a expression became upregulated during axon outgrowth of cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Rab33a was preferentially localized to the Golgi apparatus and to synaptophysin-positive vesicles that are transported along the growing axon. Previous studies showed that synaptophysin is localized to post-Golgi vesicles transported by fast axonal transport in developing neurons. Reduction of Rab33a expression by RNAi (RNA interference) inhibited the anterograde transport of synaptophysin-positive vesicles, leading to their decrease in axonal tips. Furthermore, this treatment reduced membrane fusion of synaptophysin-positive vesicles at the growth cones and inhibited axon outgrowth. Overexpression of Rab33a, on the other hand, induced excessive accumulation of synaptophysin-positive vesicles and concurrent formation of surplus axons. These data suggest that Rab33a participates in axon outgrowth by mediating anterograde axonal transport of synaptophysin-positive vesicles and their concomitant fusion at the growth cones.},

Ryanodine-sensitive, spontaneous local increases in [Ca2+]i (Ca2+ sparks) from the SR were observed just under the surface membrane of single smooth muscle cells from myogenic cerebral arteries. Ryanodine and thapsigargin inhibited Ca2+ sparks and Ca(2+)-dependent potassium (KCa) currents, suggesting that Ca2+ sparks activate KCa channels. Furthermore, KCa channels activated by Ca2+ sparks appeared to hyperpolarize and dilate pressurized myogenic arteries because ryanodine and thapsigargin depolarized and constricted these arteries to an extent similar to that produced by blockers of KCa channels. Ca2+ sparks indirectly cause vasodilation through activation of KCa channels, but have little direct effect on spatially averaged [Ca2+]i, which regulates contraction.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Sodium currents were measured under voltage-clamp conditions in Ranvier nodes of rat and frog nerve fibres at 20 degrees C. Voltage errors due to the resistance in series with the nodal membrane were minimized by reducing sodium currents with tetrodotoxin in the extracellular solutions. 2. The stationary and kinetic properties of sodium activation and inactivation were determined for a wide range of potentials (V) from -40 to 160 mV with respect to the initial holding level (V = 0 mV). 3. The curves m infinity(V) and h infinity(V) of stationary sodium activation and inactivation were not different in rat and frog fibres. 4. The time constants tau m, tau h of sodium activation and inactivation were normally larger in the rat than in the frog. At moderate depolarizations (0 less than or equal to V less than or equal to 80 mV) tau m in the rat was 15-50\% larger; the ratio of the rat to the frog tau h values was usually smaller. Thus tau m/tau h = 0.116 for the rat and 0.0965 for the frog at V = 60 mV (potential with maximum peak sodium inward current). 5. Sodium inactivation in rat nerve was slowed and became incomplete by application of intra-axonal iodate or by treatment with external Anemonia toxin II (ATX II), chloramine-T or Ruthenium Red. Peak sodium currents were not increased by these substances. 6. Wash-out of ATX II from frog nerve was rapid and complete but partly irreversible in rat nerve. This suggests different properties or accessibilities of sodium channels in frog and rat nodes.},

  Abstract                 = {We have previously shown that treatment with the thyroid hormone T(3) increases the voltage-gated Na(+)current density (Nav-D) in hippocampal neurons from postnatal rats, leading to accelerated action potential upstrokes and increased firing frequencies. Here we show that the Na(+) current regulation depends on the presence of glial cells, which secrete a heat-instable soluble factor upon stimulation with T(3). The effect of conditioned medium from T(3)-treated glial cells was mimicked by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), known to be released from cerebellar glial cells after T(3) treatment. Neutralization assays of astrocyte-conditioned media with anti-bFGF antibody inhibited the regulation of the Nav-D by T(3). This suggests that the up-regulation of the neuronal sodium current density by T(3) is not a direct effect but involves bFGF release and satellite cells. Thus glial cells can modulate neuronal excitability via secretion of paracrinely acting factors.},

  abstract    = {The beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptors (betaARs) on the surface of cardiomyocytes mediate distinct effects on cardiac function and the development of heart failure by regulating production of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The spatial localization in cardiomyocytes of these betaARs, which are coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), and the functional implications of their localization have been unclear. We combined nanoscale live-cell scanning ion conductance and fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy techniques and found that, in cardiomyocytes from healthy adult rats and mice, spatially confined beta2AR-induced cAMP signals are localized exclusively to the deep transverse tubules, whereas functional beta1ARs are distributed across the entire cell surface. In cardiomyocytes derived from a rat model of chronic heart failure, beta2ARs were redistributed from the transverse tubules to the cell crest, which led to diffuse receptor-mediated cAMP signaling. Thus, the redistribution of beta(2)ARs in heart failure changes compartmentation of cAMP and might contribute to the failing myocardial phenotype.},

Here we report a method based on superresolution scanning ion conductance imaging of small synapses in culture at approximately 100-150 nm 3D resolution, which allows presynaptic patch-clamp recordings in all four configurations (cell-attached, inside-out, outside-out, and whole-cell). Using this technique, we report presynaptic recordings of K(+), Na(+), Cl(-), and Ca(2+) channels. This semiautomated approach allows direct investigation of the distribution and properties of presynaptic ion channels at small central synapses.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent data have demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is expressed by subsets of neurons, coincident with angiogenesis within the developing cerebral cortex. Here we investigate the characteristics of VEGF expression by neurons and test the hypothesis that VEGF may serve both paracrine and autocrine functions in the developing central nervous system. To begin to address these questions, we assayed expression of VEGF and one of its potential receptors, Flk-1 (VEGFR-2), in the embryonic mouse forebrain and embryonic cortical neurons grown in vitro. Both VEGF and Flk-1 are present in subsets of post-mitotic neurons in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, VEGF levels are up-regulated in neuronal cultures subjected to hypoxia, consistent with our previous results in vivo. While the abundance of Flk-1 is unaffected by hypoxia, the receptor exhibits a higher level of tyrosine phosphorylation, as do downstream signaling kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, p90RSK and STAT3a, demonstrating activation of the VEGF pathway. These same signaling components also exhibited higher tyrosine phosphorylation levels in response to exogenous addition of rVEGFA(165). This activation was diminished in the presence of specific inhibitors of Flk-1 function and agents that sequester VEGF, resulting in a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis in these neuronal cultures. Further, inhibition of MEK resulted in increased apoptosis, while inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase had no appreciable affect. In addition to the novel function for VEGF that we describe in neuronal survival, neuronal VEGF also affected the organization and differentiation of brain endothelial cells in a three-dimensional culture paradigm, consistent with its more traditional role as a vascular agent. Thus, our in vitro data support a role for neuronal VEGF in both paracrine and autocrine signaling in the maintenance of neurons and endothelia in the central nervous system.},

  Abstract                 = {Neuropilin (NRP) 1, previously identified as a neuronal receptor that mediates repulsive growth cone guidance, has been shown recently to function also in endothelial cells as an isoform-specific receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)(165) and as a coreceptor in vitro of VEGF receptor 2. However, its potential role in pathologic angiogenesis remains unknown. In the present study, we first show that VEGF selectively up-regulates NRP1 but not NRP2 via the VEGF receptor 2-dependent pathway. By NRP1 binding analysis, we showed that its induction by VEGF accompanies functional receptor expression. Endothelial proliferation stimulated by VEGF(165) was inhibited significantly by antibody perturbation of NRP1. In a murine model of VEGF-dependent angioproliferative retinopathy, intense NRP1 mRNA expression was observed in the newly formed vessels. Furthermore, selective NRP1 inhibition in this model suppressed neovascular formation substantially. These results suggest that VEGF cannot only activate endothelial cells directly but also can contribute to robust angiogenesis in vivo by a mechanism that involves up-regulation of its cognate receptor expression.},

  Abstract                 = {Single living cells were studied in growth medium by atomic force microscopy at a high--down to one image frame per second--imaging rate over time periods of many hours, stably producing hundreds of consecutive scans with a lateral resolution of approximately 30-40 nm. The cell was held by a micropipette mounted onto the scanner-piezo as shown in Häberle, W., J. K. H. Hörber, and G. Binnig. 1991. Force microscopy on living cells. J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B9:1210-0000. To initiate specific processes on the cell surface the cells had been infected with pox viruses as reported earlier and, most likely, the liberation of a progeny virion by the still-living cell was observed, hence confirming and supporting earlier results (Häberle, W., J. K. H. Hörber, F. Ohnesorge, D. P. E. Smith, and G. Binnig. 1992. In situ investigations of single living cells infected by viruses. Ultramicroscopy. 42-44:1161-0000; Hörber, J. K. H., W. Häberle, F. Ohnesorge, G. Binnig, H. G. Liebich, C. P. Czerny, H. Mahnel, and A. Mayr. 1992. Investigation of living cells in the nanometer regime with the atomic force microscope. Scanning Microscopy. 6:919-930). Furthermore, the pox viruses used were characterized separately by AFM in an aqueous environment down to the molecular level. Quasi-ordered structural details were resolved on a scale of a few nm where, however, image distortions and artifacts due to multiple tip effects are probably involved--just as in very high resolution (<15-20 nm) images on the cells. Although in a very preliminary manner, initial studies on the mechanical resonance properties of a single living (noninfected) cell, held by the micropipette, have been performed. In particular, frequency response spectra were recorded that indicate elastic properties and enough stiffness of these cells to make the demonstrated rapid scanning of the imaging tip plausible. Measurements of this kind, especially if they can be proven to be cell-type specific, may perhaps have a large potential for biomedical applications. Images of these living cells were also recorded in the widely known (e.g., Radmacher, M., R. W. Tillmann, and H. E. Gaub. 1993. Imaging viscoelasticity by force modulation with the atomic force microscope. Biophys. J. 64:735-742) force modulation mode, yet at one low modulation frequency of approximately 2 kHz. (Note: After the cells were attached to the pipette by suction, they first deformed significantly and then reassumed their original spherical shape, which they also acquire when freely suspended in solution, to a great extent with the exception of the portion adjusting to the pipette edge geometry after approximately 0.5-1 h, which occurred in almost the same manner with uninfected cells, and those that had been infected several hours earlier. This seems to be a process which is at least actively supported by the cellular cytoskeleton, rather than a mere osmotic pressure effect induced by electrolyte transport through the membrane. Furthermore, several hours postinfection (p.i.) infected cells developed many optically visible refraction effects, which appeared as small dark spots in the light microscope, that we believed to be the regions in the cell plasma where viruses are assembled; this is known from the literature on electron microscopy on pox-infected cells and referred to there as "virus factories" (e.g., Moss, B. 1986. Replication of pox viruses. In Fundamental Virology, B. N. Fields and D. M. Knape, editors. Raven Press, New York. 637-655). Therefore, we assume that the cells stay alive during imaging, in our experience for approximately 30-45 h p.i.).},

  Abstract                 = {The neuronal growth cone plays a crucial role in the development of the nervous system. This highly motile structure leads the axon to its final destination by translating guidance cues into cytoskeletal rearrangements. Recently, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is essential for angiogenesis and vascular sprouting, has been found to exert a trophic activity also on neurons, leading to an increased axonal outgrowth, similar to the well-known nerve growth factor (NGF). The neurotrophic properties of VEGF are likely to be promoted via the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1). In the long term, VEGF attracts and influences the growth cone velocity and leads to growth cone enlargement. The present study focuses on immediate VEGF effects using RFP-actin and GFP-NF-M microinjected chicken dorsal root ganglia for live cell imaging of the neuronal growth cone. We analyzed actin and neurofilament dynamics following VEGF and NGF treatment and compared the effects. Furthermore, key signaling pathways of VEGF were investigated by specific blocking of VEGFR-2 or NRP-1. With the aid of confocal laser scanning microscopy and stimulated emission depletion microscopy, we show for the first time that VEGF has a quick effect on the actin-cytoskeleton, since actin rearrangements were identifiable within a few minutes, leading to a dramatically increased motion. Moreover, these effects were strongly enhanced by adding both VEGF and NGF. Most notably, the effects were inhibited by blocking VEGFR-2, therefore we propose that the immediate effects of VEGF on the actin-cytoskeleton are mediated through VEGFR-2.},

  Abstract                 = {Golli proteins, products of the myelin basic protein gene, function as a new type of modulator of intracellular Ca(2+) levels in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Because of this, they affect a number of Ca(2+)-dependent functions, such as OPC migration and process extension. To examine further the Ca(2+) channels regulated by golli, we studied the store-operated Ca(2+) channels (SOCCs) in OPCs and acute brain slice preparations from golli knock-out and golli-overexpressing mice. Our results showed that pharmacologically induced Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores evoked a significant extracellular Ca(2+) entry after store depletion in OPCs. They also indicated that, under these pharmacological conditions, golli promoted activation of Ca(2+) influx by SOCCs in cultured OPCs as well as in tissue slices. The canonical transient receptor potential family of Ca(2+) channels (TRPCs) has been postulated to be SOCC subunits in oligodendrocytes. Using a small interfering RNA knockdown approach, we provided direct evidence that TRPC1 is involved in store-operated Ca(2+) influx in OPCs and that it is modulated by golli. Furthermore, our data indicated that golli is probably associated with TRPC1 at OPC processes. Additionally, we found that TRPC1 expression is essential for the effects of golli on OPC proliferation. In summary, our data indicate a key role for golli proteins in the regulation of TRPC-mediated Ca(2+) influx, a finding that has profound consequences for the regulation of multiple biological processes in OPCs. More important, we have shown that extracellular Ca(2+) uptake through TRPC1 is an essential component in the mechanism of OPC proliferation.},

  Abstract                 = {Migration of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) from proliferative zones to their final location in the brain is an essential step in nervous system development. Golli proteins, products of the myelin basic protein gene, can modulate voltage-gated Ca(2+) uptake in OPCs during process extension and retraction. Given the importance of process extension/retraction on movement, the consequences of golli expression on OPC migration were examined in vivo and in vitro using time-lapse imaging of isolated OPCs and acute brain slice preparations from golli KO and golli J37 overexpressing mice (JOE). The results indicated that golli stimulated migration, and this enhanced motility was associated with increases in the activity of voltage operated Ca(2+) channels (VOCCs). Activation of VOCCs by high K(+) resulted in a significant increase in the migration speed of JOE OPCs versus control cells and golli-mediated modulation of OPC migration disappeared in the presence of VOCC antagonists. During migration, OPCs generated Ca(2+) oscillations that were dependent on voltage-calcium influx and both the amplitude and frequency of these Ca(2+) transients correlated positively with the rate of cell movement under a variety of pharmacological treatments. The Ca(2+) transient amplitude and the rate of cell movement were significantly lower in KO cells and significantly higher in JOE cells suggesting that the presence of golli promotes OPC migration by increasing the size of voltage-mediated Ca(2+) oscillations. These data define a new molecule that regulates Ca(2+) homeostasis in OPCs, and are the first to demonstrate that voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels can regulate an OPC function, such as migration.},

Binding to either semaphorins or VEGF, NRP1 acts with plexins to regulate neuronal guidance, or with VEGFR2 to mediate vascular development. We have generated two monoclonal antibodies that bind to the Sema- and VEGF-binding domains of NRP1, respectively. Both antibodies reduce angiogenesis and vascular remodeling, while having little effect on other VEGFR2-mediated events. Importantly, anti-NRP1 antibodies have an additive effect with anti-VEGF therapy in reducing tumor growth. Vessels from tumors treated with anti-VEGF show a close association with pericytes, while tumors treated with both anti-NRP1 and anti-VEGF lack this organization. We propose that blocking NRP1 function inhibits vascular remodeling, rendering vessels more susceptible to anti-VEGF therapy.},

  Abstract                 = {Aquaporin (AQP) water channels are expressed primarily in cell plasma membranes. In this paper, we review recent evidence that AQPs facilitate cell migration. AQP-dependent cell migration has been found in a variety of cell types in vitro and in mice in vivo. AQP1 deletion reduces endothelial cell migration, limiting tumor angiogenesis and growth. AQP4 deletion slows the migration of reactive astrocytes, impairing glial scarring after brain stab injury. AQP1-expressing tumor cells have enhanced metastatic potential and local infiltration. Impaired cell migration has also been seen in AQP1-deficient proximal tubule epithelial cells, and AQP3-deficient corneal epithelial cells, enterocytes, and skin keratinocytes. The mechanisms by which AQPs enhance cell migration are under investigation. We propose that, as a consequence of actin polymerization/depolymerization and transmembrane ionic fluxes, the cytoplasm adjacent to the leading edge of migrating cells undergoes rapid changes in osmolality. AQPs could thus facilitate osmotic water flow across the plasma membrane in cell protrusions that form during migration. AQP-dependent cell migration has potentially broad implications in angiogenesis, tumor metastasis, wound healing, glial scarring, and other events requiring rapid, directed cell movement. AQP inhibitors may thus have therapeutic potential in modulating these events, such as slowing tumor growth and spread, and reducing glial scarring after injury to allow neuronal regeneration.},

The prevention of membrane damage is affected by trivalent and divalent cations, by low pH, by low ionic strength and by high osmotic pressure. The inhibitory role of protons and divalent cations is considered in greater detail: pore-forming agents can be classified into two groups: channels across planar lipid bilayers induced by the first group display voltage-sensitive, reversible inhibition by divalent cations; channels of the second group show voltage-insensitive, irreversible inhibition by divalent cations. A search for the ligands to which divalent cations and protons bind has proved elusive. Comparison with the phenomenon of 'surface conductance' through narrow apertures, that is manifest in the absence of any pore-forming agent, may prove fruitful.},

Such a scheme allows for a better control of the tip position because the AC ionic current is more sensitive to the probe-surface distance than the DC ionic current used previously. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of this technique to the imaging of topographically rough specimens and high-resolution imaging over selected small areas. We also show that it is possible to record the DC ionic current simultaneously during the scan, which can reveal additional information not apparent in the images obtained with the AC ionic current.},

The site-specific recombinase Cre can be used to recombine loxP-modified alleles under temporal and spatial control. However, the efficient delivery of biologically active Cre recombinase to living cells represents a limiting factor. In this study we compared the potential of a hydrophobic peptide modified from Kaposi fibroblast growth factor with a basic peptide derived from HIV-TAT to promote cellular uptake of recombinant Cre. We present the production and characterization of a Cre protein that enters mammalian cells and subsequently performs recombination with high efficiency in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Histidine-tagged Cre recombinase transduced inefficiently unless fused to a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Fusion of NLS-Cre to the fibroblast growth factor transduction peptide did not improve the transducibility, whereas fusion with the TAT peptide significantly enhanced cellular uptake and subsequent recombination. More than 95\% recombination efficiency in fibroblast cells, as well as murine embryonic stem cells, was achieved after His-TAT-NLS-Cre transduction. Efficient recombination could also be obtained in primary splenocytes ex vivo. We expect that application of His-TAT-NLS-Cre, which can be produced readily in large quantities from a bacterial source, will expand our abilities to manipulate mammalian genomes.},

We demonstrate effective growth cone remodelling using a 5\% criterion (near-scanning). Recurrent line near-scanning aligned growth cone processes along the scan line. The new membrane protrusions, marked by DiI, started a few minutes after scanning onset and progressively grew in thickness. Using scanning patterns suitable for connecting distinct growth cones, new links were consistently developed. Although the underlying mechanism is still a matter for investigation, a mechanical perturbation produced by the moving probe appeared to induce the process formation. Thanks to its deterministic and interactive features, this novel approach to guiding growth cones is a promising way to develop networks of identified neurons as well as link them with artificial structures.},

  Abstract                 = {Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) is a scanning probe microscopy particularly suitable for the investigation of living biological specimens due to its low invasivity. Recently, this technique has been used not only to perform 3D-imaging, but also to stimulate and guide neuronal growth cones. In particular, it has been demonstrated that one can guide the cone growth for tens of micrometres by means of recurrent and non-contact SICM scanning along a defined line, with a pipette having an internal hydrostatic pressure. Accurate measurements of the mechanical forces acting on the cell membrane in these stimulation protocols are essential to explain the biological mechanisms involved. Herein a setup specifically developed for this purpose, combining together SICM, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and inverted optical microscopy is described. In this configuration, a SICM pipette can be approached to an AFM cantilever while monitoring the cantilever deflection as a function of the hydrostatic pressure applied to the pipette and the relative distance. In this way, one can directly measure mechanical forces down to 20&#8197;pN. The same apparatus is thus sufficient to calibrate a given pipette and immediately use it to study the hydrostatic pressure effects on living cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) is currently used for high resolution topographic imaging of living cells. Recently, it has been also employed as a tool to deliver stimuli to the cells. In this work we have investigated the mechanical interaction occurring between the pipette tip and the sample during SICM operation. For the purpose, we have built a setup combining SICM with atomic force microscopy (AFM), where the AFM cantilever replaces the sample. Our data indicate that, operating in far-scanning mode with current decrease values below 2\%, no force can be detected, provided that the level of the electrolyte filling the pipette is equal to that determined by the capillary tension. A filling level different from this value determines a hydrostatic pressure, a flux through the pipette tip and detectable forces, even in far-scanning mode. The absolute value of these forces depends on the pipette tip size. Therefore, a possible pitfall when using SICM for cell imaging is to imply zero-force working conditions. However the hydrostatic forces can be exploited in order to deliver weak mechanical stimuli and guide neuronal growth cones. Evidences of the effectiveness of this approach are herein given.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowledge of mechanical properties of living cells is essential to understand their physiological and pathological conditions. To measure local cellular elasticity, scanning probe techniques have been increasingly employed. In particular, non-contact scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) has been used for this purpose; thanks to the application of a hydrostatic pressure via the SICM pipette. However, the measurement of sample deformations induced by weak pressures at a short distance has not yet been carried out. A direct quantification of the applied pressure has not been also achieved up to now. These two issues are highly relevant, especially when one addresses the investigation of thin cell regions. In this paper, we present an approach to solve these problems based on the use of a setup integrating SICM, atomic force microscopy, and optical microscopy. In particular, we describe how we can directly image the pipette aperture in situ. Additionally, we can measure the force induced by a constant hydrostatic pressure applied via the pipette over the entire probe-sample distance range from a remote point to contact. Then, we demonstrate that the sample deformation induced by an external pressure applied to the pipette can be indirectly and reliably evaluated from the analysis of the current-displacement curves. This method allows us to measure the linear relationship between indentation and applied pressure on uniformly deformable elastomers of known Young's modulus. Finally, we apply the method to murine fibroblasts and we show that it is sensitive to local and temporally induced variations of the cell surface elasticity.},

Here we report the first realization of two-color STED imaging in living cells.

  Abstract                 = {The rate at which Ca(2+) returns towards the basal concentration is controlled by the action of Ca(2+) pumps, both on the plasma membrane and on organelles within the cytosol. The distribution of Ca(2+) uptake sites within the cytosol was investigated using rapid confocal imaging (55 ms/frame) of fluo3-loaded human neutrophils. In some zones within the cell, the uptake of Ca(2+) from the cytosol followed a single exponential time course, whereas in others, there was accelerated kinetics after about 3 s. Using the full array of data, to produce a cell-map of Ca(2+) uptake rates a clear nonuniformity of Ca(2+) uptake sites throughout the neutrophil cytosol was observed. The location of the Ca(2+) uptake sites did not correlate with the granules or the main body of the nucleus, but Ca(2+) uptake was highest near the vestigial Golgi/ER, the edges of the nuclear lobes and at the leading cell edge. The possibility exists that the nonuniform distribution of Ca(2+) uptake sites plays a role in restricting Ca(2+) signals with the neutrophil cytosol.},

  Abstract                 = {A confocal laser scanning technique was used to provide optical sections in the vertical plane through living neutrophils during engagement of integrin and shape change. This has permitted the visualisation of cytosolic free Ca2+ rises localised to the sites of integrin immobilisation. These localised Ca2+ changes resulted from the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and were not inhibited by removal of extracellular Ca2+ or by the Ca2+ channel blocking nickel ions. After integrin engagement and initial cell shape changes, a second rapid phase of cell spreading occurred, which was accompanied by global Ca2+ signalling bursts that continued sporadically after maximum spreading. This global signalling was driven mainly by Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium. We propose that the localised and global Ca2+ signalling triggered by integrin engagement results from a common underlying mechanism and these signals are important for neutrophil shape change and extravasation.},

Total internal reflection fluorescence from CoroNa Green dye in the bath for Na(+) ions or fluorescein in the bath for pH quantified the resulting changes in local surface concentration. These changes had a time response as short as 10 ms and a radius of 1-30 microm and depended on the diameter of the pipet used, the applied voltage, and the pipet-surface separation. After the pipet dosing was characterized in detail, two proof-of-concept experiments on single cells and single molecules were then performed. We demonstrated local control of the sodium-sensitive flagellar motor in single Escherichia coli chimera on the time scale of 1 s by dosing sodium and monitoring the rotation of a 1 microm diameter bead fixed to the flagellum. We also demonstrated triggered single-molecule unfolding by dosing acid from the pipet to locally melt individual molecules of duplex DNA, as observed using fluorescent resonance energy transfer.},

Cells were fixed and stained for the endothelial surface marker CD31 or cyclooxygenases 1 and 2. En face confocal microscopy and scanning ion conductance microscopy were used to show that endothelial cells were randomly oriented at the center of the well, aligned with shear stress nearer the periphery, and expressed cyclooxygenase-1 under all conditions. Lipopolysaccharide induced cyclooxygenase-2 and the production of 6-keto-prostaglandin F(1α) in all cells.Cyclooxygenase-1 is expressed in endothelial cells cultured under chronic shear stress of high or low directionality.},

  Abstract                 = {To measure the elongation and compliance of endothelial cells subjected to different patterns of shear stress in vitro, and to compare these parameters with the elongation and compliance of endothelial cells from different regions of the intact aorta.Porcine aortic endothelial cells were cultured for 6 days under static conditions or on an orbital shaker. The shaker generated a wave of medium, inducing pulsatile shear stress with a preferred orientation at the edge of the well or steadier shear stress with changing orientation at its centre. The topography and compliance of these cells and cells from the inner and outer curvature of ex vivo porcine aortic arches were measured by scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM).Cells cultured under oriented shear stress were more elongated and less compliant than cells grown under static conditions or under shear stress with no preferred orientation. Cells from the outer curvature of the aorta were more elongated and less compliant than cells from the inner curvature.The elongation and compliance of cultured endothelial cells vary according to the pattern of applied shear stress, and are inversely correlated. A similar inverse correlation occurs in the aortic arch, with variation between regions thought to experience different haemodynamic stresses.},

  Abstract                 = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major mediator of angiogenesis associated with tumors and other pathological conditions, including proliferative diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. The murine anti-human VEGF monoclonal antibody (muMAb VEGF) A.4.6.1 has been shown to potently suppress angiogenesis and growth in a variety of human tumor cells lines transplanted in nude mice and also to inhibit neovascularization in a primate model of ischemic retinal disease. In this report, we describe the humanization of muMAb VEGF A.4.6.1. by site-directed mutagenesis of a human framework. Not only the residues involved in the six complementarity-determining regions but also several framework residues were changed from human to murine. Humanized anti-VEGF F(ab) and IgG1 variants bind VEGF with affinity very similar to that of the original murine antibody. Furthermore, recombinant humanized MAb VEGF inhibits VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo with potency and efficacy very similar to those of muMAb VEGF A.4.6.1. Therefore, recombinant humanized MAb VEGF is suitable to test the hypothesis that inhibition of VEGF-induced angiogenesis is a valid strategy for the treatment of solid tumors and other disorders in humans.},

Fundamental mechanisms of the image formation are discussed, and novel imaging modes are introduced that exploit different aspects of the tip-sample interaction for local measurements of the micromechanical properties of the sample. As examples, images of Langmuir-Blodgett films, which map the local viscoelasticity as well as the friction coefficient, are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {We used an in vitro model for glioma cell invasion (transwell migration assay) and patch-clamp techniques to investigate the role of volume-activated Cl(-) currents (I(Cl,Vol)) in glioma cell invasion. Hypotonic solutions ( approximately 230 mOsm) activated outwardly rectifying currents that reversed near the equilibrium potential for Cl(-) ions (E(Cl)). These currents (I(Cl,Vol)) were sensitive to several known Cl(-) channel inhibitors, including DIDS, tamoxifen, and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoate (NPPB). The IC(50) for NPPB inhibition of I(Cl,Vol) was 21 microm. Under isotonic conditions, NPPB (165 microm) blocked inward currents (at -40 mV) and increased input resistance in both standard whole-cell recordings and amphotericin perforated-patch recordings. Reducing [Cl(-)](o) under isotonic conditions positively shifted the reversal potential of whole-cell currents. These findings suggest a significant resting Cl(-) conductance in glioma cells. Under isotonic and hypotonic conditions, Cl(-) channels displayed voltage- and time-dependent inactivation and had an I(-) > Cl(-) permeability. To assess the potential role of these channels in cell migration, we studied the chemotactic migration of glioma cells toward laminin or vitronectin in a Boyden chamber containing transwell filters with 8 microm pores. Inhibition of I(Cl,Vol) with NPPB reduced chemotactic migration in a dose-dependent fashion with an IC(50) of 27 microm. Time-lapse video microscopy during patch-clamp recordings revealed visible changes in cell shape and/or movement that accompanied spontaneous activation of I(Cl,Vol), suggesting that I(Cl,Vol) is activated during cell movement, consistent with the effects of NPPB in migration assays. We propose that I(Cl,Vol) contributes to cell shape and volume changes required for glioma cell migration through brain tissue.},

  Abstract                 = {An increase in cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) results from Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores and extracellular Ca(2+) influx through Ca(2+)-permeable ion channels and is crucial for initiating intestinal epithelial restitution to reseal superficial wounds after mucosal injury. Capacitative Ca(2+) entry (CCE) induced by Ca(2+) store depletion represents a major Ca(2+) influx mechanism, but the exact molecular components constituting this process remain elusive. This study determined whether canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC)1 served as a candidate protein for Ca(2+)-permeable channels mediating CCE in intestinal epithelial cells and played an important role in early epithelial restitution. Normal intestinal epithelial cells (the IEC-6 cell line) expressed TRPC1 and TPRC5 and displayed typical records of whole cell store-operated Ca(2+) currents and CCE generated by Ca(2+) influx after depletion of intracellular stores. Induced TRPC1 expression by stable transfection with the TRPC1 gene increased CCE and enhanced cell migration during restitution. Differentiated IEC-Cdx2L1 cells induced by forced expression of the Cdx2 gene highly expressed endogenous TRPC1 and TRPC5 and exhibited increased CCE and cell migration. Inhibition of TRPC1 expression by small interfering RNA specially targeting TRPC1 not only reduced CCE but also inhibited cell migration after wounding. These findings strongly suggest that TRPC1 functions as store-operated Ca(2+) channels and plays a critical role in intestinal epithelial restitution by regulating CCE and intracellular [Ca(2+)](cyt).},

  Abstract                 = {Using ultralow light intensities that are well suited for investigating biological samples, we demonstrate whole-cell superresolution imaging by nonlinear structured-illumination microscopy. Structured-illumination microscopy can increase the spatial resolution of a wide-field light microscope by a factor of two, with greater resolution extension possible if the emission rate of the sample responds nonlinearly to the illumination intensity. Saturating the fluorophore excited state is one such nonlinear response, and a realization of this idea, saturated structured-illumination microscopy, has achieved approximately 50-nm resolution on dye-filled polystyrene beads. Unfortunately, because saturation requires extremely high light intensities that are likely to accelerate photobleaching and damage even fixed tissue, this implementation is of limited use for studying biological samples. Here, reversible photoswitching of a fluorescent protein provides the required nonlinearity at light intensities six orders of magnitude lower than those needed for saturation. We experimentally demonstrate approximately 40-nm resolution on purified microtubules labeled with the fluorescent photoswitchable protein Dronpa, and we visualize cellular structures by imaging the mammalian nuclear pore and actin cytoskeleton. As a result, nonlinear structured-illumination microscopy is now a biologically compatible superresolution imaging method.},

  Abstract                 = {Many bacteria are characterized by nanoscale ultrastructures, for example S-layers, flagella, fimbriae, or pili. The last two are especially important for attachment to different abiotic and biotic surfaces and for host-pathogen interactions. In this study, we investigated the geometric and elastic properties of pili of different Corynebacterium diphtheriae strains by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We performed quantitative contour-length analysis of bacterial pili and found that the visible contour length of the pili can be described by a log-normal distribution. Our data revealed significant strain-specific variations in the mean visible contour length of the pili, ranging from 260 to 1,590 nm. To estimate their full contour length, which is not directly accessible from the AFM images, we developed a simple correction model. Using this model, we determined the mean full contour length as 510-2,060 nm. To obtain the persistence length we used two different methods of analysis, one based on the end-to-end distance of the pili and one based on the bending angles of short segments. In comparison, the bending angle analysis proved to be more precise and resulted in persistence lengths in the narrow range of 220-280 nm, with no significant strain-specific variations. This is small compared with some other bacterial polymers, for example type IV pili, F-pili, or flagella.},

  abstract  = {Mapping the mechanical properties of living cells with high spatial and temporal resolution is important for the exploration of cell function. Widely used imaging techniques such as the atomic force microscope are generally based on direct mechanical contact between the probe and the cell{,} thereby involving the risk of damaging the cell. Here{,} we present a noncontact method for fast and quantitative stiffness mapping of living cells with sub-micrometer lateral resolution. This was achieved by repeatedly moving a pressurized nanopipette toward and away from the sample in a scanning ion conductance microscope (SICM). The pressure-induced microfluidic flow through the nanopipette produced a time-varying force on the sample surface{,} thereby locally indenting it without direct mechanical contact. Maps of sample stiffness (quantified by the Young{'}s modulus) were then determined from ion current approach curves using a finite element model. To demonstrate the capability of the method we visualized the dynamics of individual cytoskeleton fibers in living cells over several hours. Additionally{,} we found that spreading extensions of migrating fibroblast cells tend to be softer than their lamellum{,} which is consistent with a mechanism of cell migration by osmotic swelling.},

  Abstract                 = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is well known to play an important regulatory role in vascular growth and development. Because gene knock-outs of VEGF and its receptors flk-1 and flt-1 result in early embryonic lethality, determining roles for VEGF in CNS development has been particularly difficult. Recent studies have shown that VEGF is upregulated after various injuries to the adult brain and that the cytokine affords protection to cultured neurons affected by oxidative or excitotoxic stress. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that VEGF is directly neurotrophic to CNS neurons in culture. We applied VEGF to normoxic fetal organotypic cortical explants as a model of CNS neuropil, in addition to primary cortical neurons, to assess direct growth effects absent vascular or astroglial activity. We found that VEGF provided a significant dose-responsive increase in the neuronal microtubule markers TUJ1 and MAP-2, as well as mRNA for MAP-2 and flk-1. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to flk-1, but not flt-1, inhibited neuritic outgrowth, whereas inhibitors of the signaling pathways MEK1 and P13-AKT both abrogated VEGF-induced growth. VEGF applied to primary cortical neurons produced significant increases in neuronal cell body diameter and the number of emerging neurites mediated by flk-1. Possibly, VEGF achieves its effects by acting on the neuronal microtubular content, which is involved with growth, stability and maturation. Several studies have now shown that VEGF is neurotrophic and neuroprotective independent of a vascular component; we suggest that VEGF plays seminal pleiotrophic roles in CNS development and repair.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed a novel light source for use in a scanning near-field optical microscope (SNOM or NSOM) based on a nanopipette whose distance from the sample surface is controlled using scanning ion conductance microscopy. The light source is based on the general principle of the chemical reaction between a fluorophore in the pipette and ligand in the bath, to produce a highly fluorescent complex that is continually renewed at the pipette tip. In these experiments we used fluo-3 and calcium, respectively. This complex is then excited with an Ar+ laser, focused on the pipette tip, to produce the light source. This method overcomes the transmission problem of more traditional SNOM probes and has been used to acquire simultaneous high-resolution topographic and optical images of biological samples in physiological buffer. A resolution of approximately 220 nm topographic and approximately 190 nm optical was determined through imaging fixed sea-urchin sperm flagella. Live A6 cells were also imaged, demonstrating the potential of this system for SNOM imaging of living cells.},

  Abstract                 = {In endothelial cells, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces an accumulation of stress fibers associated with new actin polymerization and rapid formation of focal adhesions at the ventral surface of the cells. This cytoskeletal reorganization results in an intense motogenic activity. Using porcine endothelial cells expressing one or the other type of the VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 or VEGFR2, or human umbilical vein endothelial cells pretreated with a VEGFR2 neutralizing antibody, we show that VEGFR2 is responsible for VEGF-induced activation of the stress-activated protein kinase-2/p38 (SAPK2/p38), phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and enhanced migratory activity. Activation of SAPK2/p38 triggered actin polymerization whereas FAK, which was phosphorylated independently of SAPK2/p38, initiated assembly of focal adhesions. Both processes contributed to the formation of stress fibers. Geldanamycin, an inhibitor of HSP90 blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, assembly of focal adhesions, actin reorganization, and cell migration, all of which were reversed by overexpressing HSP90. We conclude that VEGFR2 mediates the physiological effect of VEGF on cell migration and that two independent pathways downstream of VEGFR2 regulate actin-based motility. One pathway involves SAPK2/p38 and leads to enhanced actin polymerization activity. The other involves HSP90 as a permissive signal transduction factor implicated in FAK phosphorylation and assembly of focal adhesions.},

  Abstract                 = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent chemotactic agent for endothelial cells. Yet the signalling pathways that modulate the motogenic effects of VEGF in vascular endothelial cells are still ill defined. In the present study, we found in primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) that VEGF increased cell migration and induced a marked reorganization of the microfilament network that was characterized by the formation of stress fibers and the recruitment of vinculin to focal adhesions. VEGF also stimulated the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and p38 (stress activated protein kinase-2), but not SAPK1/JNK (stress activated protein kinase-1/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase). Activation of p38 resulted in activation of MAP kinase activated protein kinase-2/3 and phosphorylation of the F-actin polymerization modulator, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). Inhibiting the VEGF-induced activation of ERK with PD098059 did not influence actin organization or cell migration but totally inhibited the VEGF-induced incorporation of thymidine into DNA. Inhibition of p38 activity by the specific inhibitor SB203580 led to an inhibition of HSP27 phosphorylation, actin reorganization and cell migration. The results indicate that the p38 pathway conveys the VEGF signal to microfilaments inducing rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton that regulate cell migration. By modulating cell migration, p38 may thus be an important regulator of angiogenesis.},

Surface-modified, 50 and 100 nm, polystyrene latex nanoparticles (NPs) were used as model particles to examine the effect of particle size and surface chemistry on transformed human alveolar epithelial type 1-like cells (TT1). Live images of TT1 exposed to amine-modified NPs taken by hopping probe ion conductance microscopy revealed severe damage and holes on cell membranes that were not observed with other types of NPs. This paralleled induction of cell detachment, cytotoxicity and apoptotic (caspase-3/7 and caspase-9) cell death, and increased release of CXCL8 (IL-8). In contrast, unmodified, carboxyl-modified 50 nm NPs and the 100 nm NPs did not cause membrane damage, and were less reactive. Thus, the susceptibility and membrane damage to respiratory epithelium following inhalation of NPs will depend on both surface chemistry (e.g., cationic) and nano-size.},

  Abstract                 = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) regulates angiogenesis, but also has important, yet poorly characterized roles in neuronal wiring. Using several genetic and in vitro approaches, we discovered a novel role for VEGF in the control of cerebellar granule cell (GC) migration from the external granule cell layer (EGL) toward the Purkinje cell layer (PCL). GCs express the VEGF receptor Flk1, and are chemoattracted by VEGF, whose levels are higher in the PCL than EGL. Lowering VEGF levels in mice in vivo or ectopic VEGF expression in the EGL ex vivo perturbs GC migration. Using GC-specific Flk1 knock-out mice, we provide for the first time in vivo evidence for a direct chemoattractive effect of VEGF on neurons via Flk1 signaling. Finally, using knock-in mice expressing single VEGF isoforms, we show that pericellular deposition of matrix-bound VEGF isoforms around PC dendrites is necessary for proper GC migration in vivo. These findings identify a previously unknown role for VEGF in neuronal migration.},

Numerical simulation of a nanopipette model was performed through coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations. Simulation results suggest the highest degree of rectification does not always appear at lowest electrolyte concentration. To support this model with experimental evidence, pipettes with various geometries were prepared and characterized with current-voltage measurements. Exact geometries of individual pipettes were obtained by scanning electron and scanning transmission microscopies. Current-voltage responses of pipettes with tip radii that varied from 14 nm to 3800 nm and cone angles that varied from 5.0° to 66° were measured as a function of electrolyte concentrations over the range of 1 mM to 1000 mM. These studies of ion transport mechanisms through nanopipettes provide a basis for applications of nanopipettes as delivery tools, separation devices or biosensors.},

The role of AQP1 in endothelial cell function is unknown. Here we show remarkably impaired tumour growth in AQP1-null mice after subcutaneous or intracranial tumour cell implantation, with reduced tumour vascularity and extensive necrosis. A new mechanism for the impaired angiogenesis was established from cell culture studies. Although adhesion and proliferation were similar in primary cultures of aortic endothelia from wild-type and from AQP1-null mice, cell migration was greatly impaired in AQP1-deficient cells, with abnormal vessel formation in vitro. Stable transfection of non-endothelial cells with AQP1 or with a structurally different water-selective transporter (AQP4) accelerated cell migration and wound healing in vitro. Motile AQP1-expressing cells had prominent membrane ruffles at the leading edge with polarization of AQP1 protein to lamellipodia, where rapid water fluxes occur. Our findings support a fundamental role of water channels in cell migration, which is central to diverse biological phenomena including angiogenesis, wound healing, tumour spread and organ regeneration.},

  Abstract                 = {Aquaporin-4, the major water-selective channel in astroglia throughout the central nervous system, facilitates water movement into and out of the brain. Here, we identify a novel role for aquaporin-4 in astroglial cell migration, as occurs during glial scar formation. Astroglia cultured from the neocortex of aquaporin-4-null mice had similar morphology, proliferation and adhesion, but markedly impaired migration determined by Transwell migration efficiency (18+/-2 vs 58+/-4\% of cells migrated towards 10\% serum in 8 hours; P<0.001) and wound healing rate (4.6 vs 7.0 microm/hour speed of wound edge; P<0.001) compared with wild-type mice. Transwell migration was similarly impaired (25+/-4\% migrated cells) in wild-type astroglia after approximately 90\% reduction in aquaporin-4 protein expression by RNA inhibition. Aquaporin-4 was polarized to the leading edge of the plasma membrane in migrating wild-type astroglia, where rapid shape changes were seen by video microscopy. Astroglial cell migration was enhanced by a small extracellular osmotic gradient, suggesting that aquaporin-4 facilitates water influx across the leading edge of a migrating cell. In an in vivo model of reactive gliosis and astroglial cell migration produced by cortical stab injury, glial scar formation was remarkably impaired in aquaporin-4-null mice, with reduced migration of reactive astroglia towards the site of injury. Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of aquaporin-4 in astroglial cell migration, which occurs during glial scar formation in brain injury, stroke, tumor and focal abscess.},

  Abstract                 = {Most proteins have uneven distributions in the plasma membrane. Broadly speaking, this may be caused by mechanisms specific to each protein, or may be a consequence of a general pattern that affects the distribution of all membrane proteins. The latter hypothesis has been difficult to test in the past. Here, we introduce several approaches based on click chemistry, through which we study the distribution of membrane proteins in living cells, as well as in membrane sheets. We found that the plasma membrane proteins form multi-protein assemblies that are long lived (minutes), and in which protein diffusion is restricted. The formation of the assemblies is dependent on cholesterol. They are separated and anchored by the actin cytoskeleton. Specific proteins are preferentially located in different regions of the assemblies, from their cores to their edges. We conclude that the assemblies constitute a basic mesoscale feature of the membrane, which affects the patterning of most membrane proteins, and possibly also their activity.},

Our method prevents any physical contact and damage to the cell membrane by use of a pressure jet applied via the nanopipette. The study used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and measurements of intracellular Ca2+ concentration to validate the application of the mechanical stimulation protocols in human and rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. We were able, for the first time, to produce a non-contact, controlled mechanical stimulation on living neurites of human DRG neurons.

  Abstract                 = {Mechanosensitivity in living biological tissue is a study area of increasing importance, but investigative tools are often inadequate. We have developed a noncontact nanoscale method to apply quantified positive and negative force at defined positions to the soft responsive surface of living cells. The method uses applied hydrostatic pressure (0.1-150 kPa) through a pipette, while the pipette-sample separation is kept constant above the cell surface using ion conductance based distance feedback. This prevents any surface contact, or contamination of the pipette, allowing repeated measurements. We show that we can probe the local mechanical properties of living cells using increasing pressure, and hence measure the nanomechanical properties of the cell membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton in a variety of cells (erythrocytes, epithelium, cardiomyocytes and neurons). Because the cell surface can first be imaged without pressure, it is possible to relate the mechanical properties to the local cell topography. This method is well suited to probe the nanomechanical properties and mechanosensitivity of living cells.},

  Abstract                 = {The Ca(2+)-calmodulin (CaM)-dependent activation of myosin light chain kinase is inhibited by ruthenium red competitively with respect to Ca2+, with a Ki value of 8.6 microM. The binding of Ca2+ to CaM is inhibited by micromolar concentrations of ruthenium red. In the absence of Ca2+, CaM has two binding sites for ruthenium red with the dissociation constants of 0.36 and 8.7 microM, respectively. Ca2+ antagonizes the binding of ruthenium red to the low-affinity site on CaM. Binding of ruthenium red to the high-affinity site is not affected by Ca2+. The low- and high-affinity sites for ruthenium red are shown to be located in the NH2-terminal half and the COOH-terminal half of CaM, respectively. Lower concentrations of ruthenium red are needed for enzyme inactivation than for the dissociation of enzyme-CaM-Sepharose complex, suggesting these events have different Ca2+ requirements. Moreover, ruthenium red inhibits Ca(2+)-induced contraction of depolarized vascular smooth muscle in a competitive manner with respect to Ca2+. These results suggest that ruthenium red may be a new type of CaM antagonist that inhibits the binding of Ca2+ to CaM and thereby inhibits Ca(2+)-CaM-dependent enzymes and smooth muscle contraction competitively with respect to Ca2+.},

  Abstract                 = {The quantitative analysis of the contribution of ion fluxes through membrane channels to changes of intracellular ion concentrations would benefit from the exact knowledge of the cell volume. It would allow direct correlation of ionic current measurements with simultaneous measurements of ion concentrations in individual cells. Because of various limitations of conventional light microscopy a simple method for accurate cell volume determination is lacking. We have combined the optical sectioning capabilities of fluorescence laser scanning confocal microscopy and the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to study the correlation between cell volume and membrane capacitance. Single cardiac myocytes loaded with the fluorescent dye calcein were optically sectioned to produce a series of confocal images. The volume of cardiac myocytes of three different mammalian species was determined by three-dimensional volume rendering of the confocal images. The calculated cell volumes were 30.4 +/- 7.3 pl (mean +/- SD) in rabbits (n = 28), 30.9 +/- 9.0 pl in ferrets (n = 23), and 34.4 +/- 7.0 pl in rats (n = 21), respectively. There was a positive linear correlation between membrane capacitance and cell volume in each animal species. The capacitance-volume ratios were significantly different among species (4.58 +/- 0.45 pF/pl in rabbit, 5.39 +/- 0.57 pF/pl in ferret, and 8.44 +/- 1.35 pF/pl in rat). Furthermore, the capacitance-volume ratio was dependent on the developmental stage (8.88 +/- 1.14 pF/pl in 6-month-old rats versus 6.76 +/- 0.62 pF/pl in 3-month-old rats). The data suggest that the ratio of surface area:volume of cardiac myocytes undergoes significant developmental changes and differs among mammalian species. We further established that the easily measurable parameters of cell membrane capacitance or the product of cell length and width provide reliable but species-dependent estimates for the volume of individual cells.},

To provide a meaningful context for these studies, we took an unbiased approach of correlative electron microscopy of neurons migrating through a three-dimensional matrix, and characterized the cytoskeletal events that occur as migrating neurons initiate saltatory forward movements of the cell nucleus. The formation of a cytoplasmic dilation in the proximal leading process precedes nuclear translocation. Cell nuclei translocate into these dilations in saltatory movements. Time-lapse imaging and pharmacological perturbation suggest that nucleokinesis requires stepwise or hierarchical interactions between microtubules, myosin II, and cell adhesion. We hypothesize that these interactions couple leading process extension to nuclear translocation during neuronal migration.},

We report that MTs explore the peripheral domain (P-domain), exhibiting classical properties of dynamic instability. MT extension occurs preferentially along filopodia, which function as MT polymerization guides. Filopodial bundles undergo retrograde flow and also transport MTs. Thus, distal MT position is determined by the rate of plus-end MT assembly minus the rate of retrograde F-actin flow. Short MT displacements independent of flow are sometimes observed. MTs loop, buckle, and break as they are transported into the T-zone by retrograde flow. MT breakage results in exposure of new plus ends which can regrow, and minus ends which rapidly undergo catastrophes, resulting in efficient MT turnover. We also report a previously undetected presence of F-actin arc structures, which exhibit persistent retrograde movement across the T-zone into the central domain (C-domain) at approximately 1/4 the rate of P-domain flow. Actin arcs interact with MTs and transport them into the C-domain. Interestingly, although the MTs associated with arcs are less dynamic than P-domain MTs, they elongate efficiently as a result of markedly lower catastrophe frequencies.},

Biophys. Acta 978, 145-150). The rate of channel inactivation strongly depends on the phospholipid to cholesterol molar ratio of the membrane. The channel inactivation is suggested to be the result of an interaction between gramicidin and cholesterol in a stoichiometry of 1:5. Cholesterol dependent inactivation is shown also for gramicidin A analogs: tryptophan-N-formylated gramicidin A, o-pyromellitilgramicidin and malonylbisdesformylgramicidin. When cholesterol in the membrane is substituted by sitosterol, the inactivation of gramicidin-induced cation permeability is preserved, while in the presence of either ergosterol or 7-dehydrocholesterol no indication of the channel inactivation is observed. Thus, the structure of the 'B', ring, not the apolar tail of the sterol molecule, appears to be important in the inactivation process.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Migration of microglial cells towards damaged tissue plays a key role in central nervous system regeneration under pathological conditions. Using time lapse video microscopy we show that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) enhances chemokinetic migration of murine microglial cells. In the presence of 1 micro m LPA, the mean migration rate of microglial cells was increased 3.8-fold. In patch-clamp studies we demonstrate that LPA induces activation of a Ca(2+)-activated K(+) current. Microglial Ca(2+)-activated K(+) currents were abolished by either 50 nm charybdotoxin or 10 micro m clotrimazole. In contrast, 5 micro m paxilline did not have any significant effects on Ca(2+)-activated K(+) currents. The LPA-stimulated migration of microglial cells was inhibited by blockers of IKCa1 Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels. The mean migration rate of LPA-stimulated cells was decreased by 61\% in the presence of 50 nm charybdotoxin or by 51\% during exposure to 10 micro m clotrimazole. Microglial migration was not inhibited by 5 micro m paxilline. It is concluded that IKCa1 Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels are required for LPA-stimulated migration of microglial cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Oligodendrocyte precursor cells are purported to migrate over long distances into the various brain regions where they differentiate into oligodendrocytes and fulfill their appropriate tasks, i.e., myelination of axons. Here we characterize motile oligodendrocyte precursor cells in detail. Video-time lapse analysis was performed on isolated precursor cells in single cell cultures, in co-culture with cerebellar microexplants, and in living brain slices. Motility analysis of individual cells was combined with electrophysiological, immunological, and morphological characterizations. Translocation of the cell bodies was not continuous but occurred in waves. All motile cells exhibited a simple morphology and most, but not all, of them expressed the A2B5 epitope in vitro. Patch clamp analysis of the motile cells confirmed that they belong to the O-2A lineage. The percentage of motile cells, as well as their velocities, were enhanced on substrate-coated laminin in comparison to poly-L-lysine. Motility was not influenced by the presence of cerebellar microexplants. O-2A progenitor cells did not migrate strictly along neurite fascicles which were projected from the microexplants. Glial progenitor cells in situ also did not strictly migrate along the main direction of the axonal fibers of the corpus callosum but rather traversed the fibers with an overall direction toward the cortex. After Lucifer Yellow filling of the motile progenitor cells in situ, we could demonstrate that they were dye-coupled to yet unidentified cells of the corpus callosum.},

  Abstract                 = {We previously demonstrated that the primary cilium coordinates platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (PDGFR) alpha-mediated migration in growth-arrested fibroblasts. In this study, we investigate the functional relationship between ciliary PDGFR-alpha and the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE1 in directional cell migration. NHE1 messenger RNA and protein levels are up-regulated in NIH3T3 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) during growth arrest, which is concomitant with cilium formation. NHE1 up-regulation is unaffected in Tg737(orpk) MEFs, which have no or very short primary cilia. In growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells, NHE1 is activated by the specific PDGFR-alpha ligand PDGF-AA. In wound-healing assays on growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells and wild-type MEFs, NHE1 inhibition by 5'-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride potently reduces PDGF-AA-mediated directional migration. These effects are strongly attenuated in interphase NIH3T3 cells, which are devoid of primary cilia, and in Tg737(orpk) MEFs. PDGF-AA failed to stimulate migration in NHE1-null fibroblasts. In conclusion, stimulation of directional migration in response to ciliary PDGFR-alpha signals is specifically dependent on NHE1 activity, indicating that NHE1 activation is a critical event in the physiological response to PDGFR-alpha stimulation.},

  abstract    = {Migration of transformed renal epithelial cells (transformed Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, MDCK-F cells) relies on the activity of a Ca(2+)-sensitive K+ channel (IK channel) that is more active at the rear end of these cells. We have postulated that intermittent IK channel activity induces local cell shrinkage at the rear end of migrating MDCK-F cells and thereby supports the cytoskeletal mechanisms of migration. However, due to the complex morphology of MDCK-F cells we have not yet been able to measure volume changes directly. The aim of the present study was to devise a new technique employing atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure the volume of MDCK-F cells in their physiological environment and to demonstrate its dependence on IK channel activity. The spatial (x, y' and z) co-ordinates of each pixel of the three-dimensional image of MDCK-F cells allow calculation of the volume of the column "underneath" a given pixel. Thus, total cell volume is the sum of all pixel-defined columns. The mean volume of 17 MDCK-F cells was 2500+/-300 fl. Blockade of the IK channel with the specific inhibitor charybdotoxin (CTX) increased cell volume by 17+/-4\%; activation of IK by elevating the intracellular [Ca2+] with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin decreased cell volume by 19+/-3\%. Subtraction images (experimental minus control) reveal that swelling and shrinkage occur predominantly at the rear end of MDCK-F cells. In summary, our experiments show that AFM allows the measurement not only of total cell volume of living cells in their physiological environment but also the tracing of local effects induced by the polarized distribution of K+ channel activity.},

We investigated whether ischemic peripheral neuropathy could be prevented and/or reversed by gene transfer of an endothelial cell mitogen designed to promote therapeutic angiogenesis. Intramuscular gene transfer of naked DNA encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) simultaneously with induction of hindlimb ischemia in rabbits abrogated the substantial decrease in motor and sensory nerve parameters, and nerve function recovered promptly. When gene transfer was administered 10 days after induction of ischemia, nerve function was restored earlier and/or recovered faster than in untreated rabbits. These findings are due in part to enhanced hindlimb perfusion. In addition, however, the demonstration of functional VEGF receptor expression by Schwann cells indicates a direct effect of VEGF on neural integrity as well. These findings thus constitute a new paradigm for the treatment of ischemic peripheral neuropathy.},

Topics covered will be a brief overview of cytoskeletal mechanisms of migration, the role of ion channels and transporters involved in cell migration, and ways by which a polarized distribution of ion channels and transporters can be achieved in migrating cells. Moreover, a model is proposed that combines ion transport with cytoskeletal mechanisms of migration.},

Important physiological processes intimately related to the ability of the respective cells to migrate include embryogenesis, immune defense, angiogenesis, and wound healing. On the other side, migration is associated with life-threatening pathologies such as tumor metastases and atherosclerosis. Research from the last ∼15 years revealed that ion channels and transporters are indispensable components of the cellular migration apparatus.

  Abstract                 = {Migration of transformed Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK-F) cells depends on the polarized activity of a Ca2+-sensitive K+ channel. We tested whether a gradient of intracellular Ca2+-concentration ([Ca2+]i) underlies the horizontal polarization of K+ channel activity. [Ca2+]i was measured with the fluorescent dye fura-2/AM. Spatial analysis of [Ca2+]i indicated that a horizontal gradient exists, with [Ca2+]i being higher in the cell body than in the lamellipodium. Resting and maximal levels during oscillations of [Ca2+]i in the cell body were found to be 135 +/- 34 and 405 +/- 59 nml/l, respectively, whereas they were 79 +/- 18 and 307 +/- 102 nmol/l in the lamellipodium. This gradient can partially explain the preferential activation of K+ channels in the plasma membrane of the cell body. We applied a local superfusion technique during migration experiments and measurements of [Ca2+]i to test whether its maintenance is due to an uneven distribution of Ca2+ influx into migrating MDCK-F cells. Locally superfusing the cell body of migrating MDCK-F cells with La3+ alone or together with charybdotoxin, a specific blocker of Ca2+-sensitive K+ channels, slowed migration to 47 +/- 10\% and 9 +/- 5\% of control, respectively. Local blockade of Ca2+ influx into the cell body and the lamellipodium with la3+ was followed by a decrease of [Ca2+]i at both cell poles. This points to Ca2+ influx occurring over the entire cell surface. This conclusion was confirmed by locally superfusing Mn2+ over the cell body and the lamellipodium. Fura-2 fluorescence was quenched in both areas, the decrease of fluorescence being two to three times faster in the cell body than in the lamellipodium. However, this difference is insufficient to account for the observed gradient of [Ca2+]i. We hypothesize that the polarized distribution of intracellular Ca2+ stores contributes significantly to the generation of a gradient of [Ca2+]i.},

Migrating cells are involved in maintaining the integrity of our body, for instance, by defending it against invading pathogens. On the other side, migration of tumor cells may have lethal consequences when tumors spread metastatically. Thus, there is a strong interest in unraveling the cellular mechanisms underlying cell migration. The purpose of this review is to illustrate the functional importance of ion and water channels as part of the cellular migration machinery. Ion and water flow is required for optimal migration, and the inhibition or genetic ablation of channels leads to a marked impairment of migration. We briefly touch cytoskeletal mechanisms of migration as well as cell-matrix interactions. We then present some general principles by which channels can affect cell migration before we discuss each channel group separately.},

  Abstract                 = {Previously, we showed that migration of transformed renal epithelial cells (MDCK-F cells) is a K(+) channel-dependent process [J Clin Invest 1994;93:1631]. In order to determine whether K(+) channel activity is a general requirement for locomotion, we extended our observations to NIH3T3 fibroblasts and human melanoma cells. Migration of both cell types and its dependence on K(+) channel activity was measured at the single cell level by time lapse photography in the absence and presence of the specific K(+) channel blocker charybdotoxin (CTX). Locomotion of both cell types is inhibited by K(+) channel blockade. CTX slows down migration of fibroblasts and of melanoma cells dose-dependently by up to 61 +/- 11\%. These findings suggest that K(+) channel activity is a general prerequisite for migration. To determine whether CTX-induced inhibition of migration of fibroblasts and melanoma cells involves quantitative changes of actin filaments, we indirectly measured filamentous actin by quantitating binding of fluorescently labeled phalloidin. Whereas CTX elicits a decrease of bound phalloidin in fibroblasts there is an increase in melanoma cells. Since migration of tumor cells is required for invading surrounding tissue, we developed an assay to test whether CTX-induced inhibition of migration also impairs invasion of melanoma cells. Melanoma cells were seeded on a layer of high resistance renal epithelial cells (MDCK cells clone C7; transepithelial resistance R(te) >3,000 Omegacm(2)) and R(te) was measured daily. R(te) starts to decrease 2 days after seeding of melanoma cells onto MDCK-C7 cells. By day 7, R(te) has dropped to 24 +/- 1.5\% of control. K(+) channel blockade with CTX (10 nmol/l) cannot prevent or delay this drop of R(te). R(te) reaches the same level with or without CTX. These results indicate that the disruption of an epithelial layer, unlike migration of melanoma cells, cannot be modulated by K(+) channel blockade.},

This study was aimed at elucidating the functional link between the IK channel and the actin cytoskeleton which is required for cell locomotion. We monitored migration of MDCK-F cells with video microscopy, quantified filamentous actin with phalloidin binding, and measured the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) with the fluorescent dye fura-2/AM. We compared the effects of IK channel activation or inhibition with those of hypotonic swelling or hypertonic shrinkage. IK channel inhibition with charybdotoxin (CTX) or cell swelling (omission of up to 50 mmol/l NaCl) as well as IK channel activation with 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone (1-EBIO) or cell shrinkage (addition of up to 100 mmol/l mannitol) reduce the rate of migration dose-dependently by up to 80\%, i.e., to the same extent as cytochalasin D. Inhibition of migration is accompanied either by actin depolymerization (CTX and cell swelling) or by actin polymerization (1-EBIO and cell shrinkage). Changes of migration and phalloidin binding induced by CTX and cell swelling or by 1-EBIO and cell shrinkage, respectively, are linearly correlated with each other. CTX and cell swelling elicit a rise of [Ca2+]i whereas 1-EBIO and cell shrinkage induce a slight decrease of [Ca2+]i in most MDCK-F cells. Taken together IK-channel-dependent perturbations of cell volume and anisotonicity elicit virtually identical effects on migration, actin filaments and [Ca2+]i. We therefore suggest that cell volume - possibly via [Ca2+]i - is the link between IK channel activity, actin filaments and migration. We propose a model for how temporal and local changes of cell volume can support the migration of MDCK-F cells.},

Ion transport proteins and aquaporins contribute to tumour cell migration and invasion among other things by inducing local volume changes and/or by modulating Ca(2+) and H(+) signalling. Targeting cell migration therapeutically bears great clinical potential, because it is a prerequisite for metastasis. Ion transport proteins appear to be attractive candidate target proteins for this purpose because they are easily accessible as membrane proteins and often overexpressed or activated in cancer.

  Abstract                 = {Migration plays an important role in the formation of tumor metastases. Nonetheless, little is known about electrophysiological phenomena accompanying or underlying migration. Previously, we had shown that in migrating alkali-transformed Madin-Darby canine kidney focus (MDCK-F) cells a Ca(2+)-sensitive 53-pS K+ channel underlies oscillations of the cell membrane potential. The present study defines the role this channel plays in migration of MDCK-F cells. We monitored migration of individual MDCK-F cells by video imaging techniques. Under control conditions, MDCK-F cells migrated at a rate of 0.90 +/- 0.03 microns/min (n = 201). Application of K+ channel blockers (1 and 5 mmol/liter Ba2+, 5 mmol/liter tetraethylammonium, 100 mumol/liter 4-aminopyridine, 5 nmol/liter charybdotoxin) caused marked inhibition of migration, pointing to the importance of K+ channels in migration. Using patch-clamp techniques, we demonstrated the sensitivity of the Ca(2+)-sensitive 53-pS K+ channel to these blockers. Blockade of this K+ channel and inhibition of migration were closely correlated, indicating the necessity of oscillating K+ channel activity for migration. Migration of MDCK-F cells was also inhibited by furosemide or bumetanide, blockers of the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter. We present a model for migration in which oscillations of cell volume play a central role. Whenever they are impaired, migration is inhibited.},

In addition to the cytoskeleton, Ca2+ sensitive K+ channels (IK1) are also part of the cellular "migration machinery." We showed that Ca2+ sensitive K+ channels support the retraction of the rear part of migrating MDCK-F cells by inducing a localized shrinkage at this cell pole. So far the molecular nature and in particular the subcellular distribution of these channels in MDCK-F cells is unknown. We compared the effect of IK1 channel blockers and activators on the current of a cloned IK1 channel from MDCK-F cells (cIK1) and the migratory behavior of these cells. Using IK1 channels labeled with a HA-tag or the enhanced green fluorescent protein we studied the subcellular distribution of the canine (cIK1) and the human (hIK1) channel protein in different migrating cells. The functional impact of cIK1 channel activity at the front or rear part of MDCK-F cells was assessed with a local superfusion technique and a detailed morphometric analysis. We show that it is cIK1 whose activity is required for migration of MDCK-F cells. IK1 channels are found in the entire plasma membrane, but they are concentrated at the cell front. This is in part due to membrane ruffling at this cell pole. However, there appears to be only little cIK1 channel activity at the front of MDCK-F cells. In our view this apparent discrepancy can be explained by differential regulation of IK1 channels at the front and rear part of migrating cells.},

  Abstract                 = {All organic fluorophores undergo irreversible photobleaching during prolonged illumination. Although fluorescent proteins typically bleach at a substantially slower rate than many small-molecule dyes, in many cases the lack of sufficient photostability remains an important limiting factor for experiments requiring large numbers of images of single cells. Screening methods focusing solely on brightness or wavelength are highly effective in optimizing both properties, but the absence of selective pressure for photostability in such screens leads to unpredictable photobleaching behavior in the resulting fluorescent proteins. Here we describe an assay for screening libraries of fluorescent proteins for enhanced photostability. With this assay, we developed highly photostable variants of mOrange (a wavelength-shifted monomeric derivative of DsRed from Discosoma sp.) and TagRFP (a monomeric derivative of eqFP578 from Entacmaea quadricolor) that maintain most of the beneficial qualities of the original proteins and perform as reliably as Aequorea victoria GFP derivatives in fusion constructs.},

We summarize its recent applications in structural biology, with emphasis on high-resolution imaging, and illustrate these applications with images of cell membranes, DNA, and soluble and membrane proteins. With present technology, and at room temperature, nanometer resolution of DNA and soluble proteins is achievable, although the resolution attained on cell surfaces is more limited (10-50 nm). We suggest that high-resolution imaging of cell surfaces and very high (sub-nanometer) resolution molecular imaging requires an approach that increases specimen rigidity. Operation at cryogenic temperatures, the most promising approach, is discussed, and a cryo-AFM designed for operating at ambient pressure and liquid nitrogen temperature is described. The results include high-resolution images and evidence of increased molecular rigidity at low temperatures.},

The disagreement is due mainly to the inability to observe these membrane domains directly and to the widespread use of experimental approaches of dubious utility. As a lipid raft 'dilettante' who has dabbled in the area over the years, I view the lipid raft model with some skepticism and disinterest because of that confusion. Although progress in the field has helped clarify some of the issues, more work is still needed to formally confirm the lipid raft hypothesis and to reestablish the scientific credibility of this area.},

By combining this method with laser confocal microscopy, it was possible to simultaneously measure the nanometric motion of the cardiac myocyte, and the local calcium concentration just under the cell membrane.

The technique combines recently published single-molecule-resolution ion-conductance microscopy that acquires topographical data with confocal microscopy providing simultaneous fluorescent imaging. In our experiments we have demonstrated that the cell membrane exhibits numerous submicrometer-sized surface structures that could be topographically confused with virus particles. However, simultaneous acquisition of confocal images allows the positions of fluorescently tagged particles to be identified. Using this technique, we have, for the first time, visualized single polyoma VLPs adsorbed onto the cell membrane. Observed VLPs had a mean width of 108 +/- 16 nm. The particles were randomly distributed across the cell membrane, and no specific interactions were seen with cell membrane structures such as microvilli. These experiments demonstrate the utility of this new microscope for imaging the interactions of nanoparticles with the cell surface to provide novel insights into the earliest interactions of viruses and other nanoparticles such as gene therapy vectors with the cell.},

  Abstract                 = {Cells naturally operate on the nanoscale level, with molecules combining together to form complex molecular machines, which can work together to enable normal cell function or go wrong as in the case of many diseases. Visualizing these key processes on the nanoscale has been difficult and two main approaches have been used to date; nanometer resolution imaging of fixed cells using electron microscopy, or imaging live cells using optical or fluorescence microscopy, with a resolution of a few hundred nanometers. Scanning probe microscopy has the potential to allow live cells to be imaged at nanoscale resolution and a noncontact method based on the use of a nanopipette probe has been developed over the last 10 years that allows both topographic and functional imaging. The rapid progress in this area of research over the last 4 years is reviewed in this article, which shows that imaging of complex cellular structures and tissues is now possible and that these methods are now sufficiently mature to provide new insights into important diseases.},

In this paper, we describe a study of clathrin-coated pit dynamics in living cells using ion conductance microscopy to directly image the changes in pit shape, combined with simultaneous confocal microscopy to follow molecule-specific fluorescence. We find that 70\% of pits closed with the formation of a protrusion that grew on one side of the pit, covered the entire pit, and then disappeared together with pit-associated clathrin-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and actin-binding protein-EGFP (Abp1-EGFP) fluorescence. This was in contrast to conventionally closing pits that closed and cleaved from flat membrane sheets and lacked accompanying Abp1-EGFP fluorescence. Scission of both types of pits was found to be dynamin-2 dependent. This technique now enables direct spatial and temporal correlation between functional molecule-specific fluorescence and structural information to follow key biological processes at cell surfaces.},

  Abstract                 = {Angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels, is essential for preparing a closed circulatory system in the body, and for supplying oxygen and nutrition to tissues. Major diseases such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis include pathological angiogenesis in their malignant processes, suggesting anti-angiogenic therapy to be a new strategy for suppression of diseases. However, until the 1970s, the molecular basis of angiogenesis was largely unknown. In recent decades, extensive studies have revealed a variety of angiogenic factors and their receptors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-VEGFRs, Angiopoietin-Tie, Ephrin-EphRs and Delta-Notch to be the major regulators of angiogenesis in vertebrates. VEGF and its receptors play a central role in physiological as well as pathological angiogenesis, and functional inhibitors of VEGF and VEGFRs such as anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody and small molecules that block the tyrosine kinase activity of VEGFRs have recently been approved for use to treat patients with colorectal, lung, renal and liver cancers. These drugs have opened a novel field of cancer therapy, i.e. anti-angiogenesis therapy. However, as yet they cannot completely cure patients, and cancer cells could become resistant to these drugs. Thus, it is important to understand further the molecular mechanisms underlying not only VEGF-VEGFR signaling but also the VEGF-independent regulation of angiogenesis, and to learn how to improve anti-angiogenesis therapy.},

  Abstract                 = {The extent that vesicles maintain a distinct identity and morphology after fusing with the plasma membrane is controversial. We used scanning ion conductance microscopy to image changes in the surface membrane of adrenal chromaffin cells after stimulation of exocytosis with a high K(+) solution. Within several minutes after stimulation, punctate depressions, 100-600 nm wide, were noted from 16\% of the cells. The depressions were not randomly distributed, but appeared in clusters of two or more within a approximately 1 microm(2) area and disappeared after several minutes. Increases in membrane surface area, consistent with the fusion and collapse of one or more vesicles into the surface membrane, were observed in 64\% of the cells after high K(+) stimulation. Surface area increases did not occur if the high K(+) solution did not contain Ca(2+). We conclude that scanning ion conductance microscopy can be used to follow the time course of surface membrane changes resulting from exocytosis and endocytosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Vascular endothelial growth factor is a highly conserved, heparin-binding protein which mediates a number of critical developmental processes in both vertebrates and invertebrates, including angiogenesis, vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis. We employed an organotypic rat explant model (produced from embryonic day 17 fetuses) to assess the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor on brain microvasculature in general and the ventral midbrain specifically. Immunohistochemistry using antisera to rat endothelial cell antigen and laminin demonstrated a robust, dose-dependent effect of vascular endothelial growth factor, resulting in increased vessel neogenesis, branching and lumen size by three days in vitro. This effect was blocked by addition of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody. At higher doses of vascular endothelial growth factor, the effect was attenuated, though a statistically significant increase in both astrocyte, and neuronal density was observed using antisera to glial and neuronal markers. Tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (i.e. dopaminergic) neurons, particularly, exhibited increased survival in response to vascular endothelial growth factor application. Vascular endothelial growth factor had a mitogenic effect on endothelial cells and astrocytes, but not dopaminergic neurons, as demonstrated by the addition of [3H]thymidine to the cultures 2 h after the cultures were established. Similarly, results of a radioreceptor assay indicated that specific vascular endothelial growth factor binding sites were present on blood vessels and astrocytes, and were up-regulated by exposure to vascular endothelial growth factor. We conclude that, in explants of the ventral mesencephalon, exogenously applied vascular endothelial growth factor is mitogenic for endothelial cells and astrocytes, and promotes growth/survival of neurons in general and dopaminergic neurons in particular.},

  Abstract                 = {A fluid mosaic model is presented for the gross organization and structure of the proteins and lipids of biological membranes. The model is consistent with the restrictions imposed by thermodynamics. In this model, the proteins that are integral to the membrane are a heterogeneous set of globular molecules, each arranged in an amphipathic structure, that is, with the ionic and highly polar groups protruding from the membrane into the aqueous phase, and the nonpolar groups largely buried in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. These globular molecules are partially embedded in a matrix of phospholipid. The bulk of the phospholipid is organized as a discontinuous, fluid bilayer, although a small fraction of the lipid may interact specifically with the membrane proteins. The fluid mosaic structure is therefore formally analogous to a two-dimensional oriented solution of integral proteins (or lipoproteins) in the viscous phospholipid bilayer solvent. Recent experiments with a wide variety of techniqes and several different membrane systems are described, all of which abet consistent with, and add much detail to, the fluid mosaic model. It therefore seems appropriate to suggest possible mechanisms for various membrane functions and membrane-mediated phenomena in the light of the model. As examples, experimentally testable mechanisms are suggested for cell surface changes in malignant transformation, and for cooperative effects exhibited in the interactions of membranes with some specific ligands. Note added in proof: Since this article was written, we have obtained electron microscopic evidence (69) that the concanavalin A binding sites on the membranes of SV40 virus-transformed mouse fibroblasts (3T3 cells) are more clustered than the sites on the membranes of normal cells, as predicted by the hypothesis represented in Fig. 7B. T-here has also appeared a study by Taylor et al. (70) showing the remarkable effects produced on lymphocytes by the addition of antibodies directed to their surface immunoglobulin molecules. The antibodies induce a redistribution and pinocytosis of these surface immunoglobulins, so that within about 30 minutes at 37 degrees C the surface immunoglobulins are completely swept out of the membrane. These effects do not occur, however, if the bivalent antibodies are replaced by their univalent Fab fragments or if the antibody experiments are carried out at 0 degrees C instead of 37 degrees C. These and related results strongly indicate that the bivalent antibodies produce an aggregation of the surface immunoglobulin molecules in the plane of the membrane, which can occur only if the immunoglobulin molecules are free to diffuse in the membrane. This aggregation then appears to trigger off the pinocytosis of the membrane components by some unknown mechanism. Such membrane transformations may be of crucial importance in the induction of an antibody response to an antigen, as well as iv other processes of cell differentiation.},

  Abstract                 = {Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores induces Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane through store-operated channels (SOCs). This store-operated Ca2+ influx is important for the replenishment of the Ca2+ stores, and is also involved in many signaling processes by virtue of the ability of intracellular Ca2+ to act as a second messenger. For many years, the molecular identities of particular SOCs, as well as the signaling mechanisms by which these channels are activated, have been elusive. Recently, however, the mammalian proteins STIM1 and Orai1 were shown to be necessary for the activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry in a variety of mammalian cells. Here we present molecular, pharmacological, and electrophysiological properties of SOCs, with particular focus on the roles that STIM1 and Orai1 may play in the signaling processes that regulate various pathways of store-operated entry.},

  Abstract                 = {Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) is a high resolution electrochemical scanning probe technique that employs a dual-barrel theta pipet probe containing electrolyte solution and quasi-reference counter electrodes (QRCE) in each barrel. A thin layer of electrolyte protruding from the tip of the pipet ensures that a gentle meniscus contact is made with a substrate surface, which defines the active surface area of an electrochemical cell. The substrate can be an electrical conductor, semiconductor, or insulator. The main focus here is on the general case where the substrate is a working electrode, and both ion-conductance measurements between the QRCEs in the two barrels and voltammetric/amperometric measurements at the substrate can be made simultaneously. In usual practice, a small perpendicular oscillation of the probe with respect to the substrate is employed, so that an alternating conductance current (ac) develops, due to the change in the dimensions of the electrolyte contact (and hence resistance), as well as the direct conductance current (dc). It is shown that the dc current can be predicted for a fixed probe by solving the Nernst-Planck equation and that the ac response can also be derived from this response. Both responses are shown to agree well with experiment. It is found that the pipet geometry plays an important role in controlling the dc conductance current and that this is easily measured by microscopy. A key feature of SECCM is that mass transport to the substrate surface is by diffusion and, for charged analytes, ion migration which can be controlled and varied quantifiably via the bias between the two QRCEs. For a working electrode substrate this means that charged redox-active analytes can be transported to the electrode/solution interface in a well-defined and controllable manner and that relatively fast heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics can be studied. The factors controlling the voltammetric response are determined by both simulation and experiment. Experiments demonstrate the realization of simultaneous quantitative voltammetric and ion conductance measurements and also identify a general rule of thumb that the surface contacted by electrolyte is of the order of the pipet probe dimensions.},

  Abstract                 = {Nerve growth factor (NGF) was discovered 50 years ago as a molecule that promoted the survival and differentiation of sensory and sympathetic neurons. Its roles in neural development have been characterized extensively, but recent findings point to an unexpected diversity of NGF actions and indicate that developmental effects are only one aspect of the biology of NGF. This article considers expanded roles for NGF that are associated with the dynamically regulated production of NGF and its receptors that begins in development, extends throughout adult life and aging, and involves a surprising variety of neurons, glia, and nonneural cells. Particular attention is given to a growing body of evidence that suggests that among other roles, endogenous NGF signaling subserves neuroprotective and repair functions. The analysis points to many interesting unanswered questions and to the potential for continuing research on NGF to substantially enhance our understanding of the mechanisms and treatment of neurological disorders.},

  Abstract                 = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic factor, uses two receptor tyrosine kinases, FLK/KDR and FLT, to mediate its activities. We have cross-linked 125I-VEGF165 to the cell surface of various tumor cell lines and of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. High molecular mass (220 and 240 kDa) and/or lower molecular mass (165 and 175 kDa) labeled complexes were detected depending on the cell type. The 220- and 240-kDa labeled complexes were shown to contain FLT and FLK/KDR receptors, respectively. On the other hand, the 165- and 175-kDa complexes did not seem to contain FLK/KDR or FLT but instead appeared to contain novel VEGF receptors with relatively low molecular masses of approximately 120 and 130 kDa. These receptors were further characterized in breast cancer MDA MB 231 cells (231), which did not form the high molecular mass complexes and which did not express detectable amounts of flk/kdr or flt mRNA. The 231 cells displayed one VEGF165 binding site, with a Kd of 2.8 x 10(-10) M and 0.95 1.1 x 10(5) binding sites per cell. By comparison, human umbilical vein endothelial cells had two binding sites, one with a Kd of 7.5 x 10(-12) M, presumably FLK/KDR, and the other with a Kd of 2 x 10(-10) M, a value similar to the VEGF binding sites on 231 cells. These lower affinity/molecular mass receptors on 231 cells cross-linked 125I-VEGF165 but not 125I-VEGF121. Accordingly, exon 7 of VEGF, which encodes the 44 amino acids present in VEGF165 that are absent in VEGF121, was fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST). The GST-VEGF-exon 7 fusion protein bound to heparin-Sepharose with a similar affinity as VEGF165 and inhibited the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to 231 cells. Cross-linking of 125I-GST-VEGF-exon 7 to 231 cells resulted in the formation of 150- and 160-kDa labeled complexes that presumably contained the 120- and 130-kDa lower affinity/molecular mass VEGF165 receptors. It was concluded that certain tumor-derived cell lines express novel surface-associated receptors that selectively bind VEGF165 via the exon 7-encoded domain, which is absent in VEGF121.},

Overexpression of NRP1 by prostate tumor cells in vivo results in increased tumor angiogenesis and growth. We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying NRP1-mediated angiogenesis by analyzing the association of NRP1 and KDR. An intracellular complex containing NRP1 and KDR was immunoprecipitated from EC by anti-NRP1 antibodies only in the presence of VEGF165. In contrast, VEGF121, which does not bind to NRP1, did not support complex formation. Complexes containing VEGF165, NRP1, and KDR were also formed in an intercellular fashion by co-culture of EC expressing KDR only, with cells expressing NRP1 only, for example, breast carcinoma cells. VEGF165 also mediated the binding of a soluble NRP1 dimer to cells expressing KDR only, confirming the formation of such complexes. Furthermore, the formation of complexes containing KDR and NRP1 markedly increased 125I-VEGF165 binding to KDR. Our results suggest that formation of a ternary complex of VEGF165, KDR, and NRP1 potentiates VEGF165 binding to KDR. These complexes are formed on the surface of EC and in a juxtacrine manner via association of tumor cell NRP1 and EC KDR.},

We now describe the purification and the expression cloning from tumor cells of a third VEGF receptor, one that binds VEGF165 but not VEGF121. This isoform-specific VEGF receptor (VEGF165R) is identical to human neuropilin-1, a receptor for the collapsin/semaphorin family that mediates neuronal cell guidance. When coexpressed in cells with KDR, neuropilin-1 enhances the binding of VEGF165 to KDR and VEGF165-mediated chemotaxis. Conversely, inhibition of VEGF165 binding to neuropilin-1 inhibits its binding to KDR and its mitogenic activity for endothelial cells. We propose that neuropilin-1 is a novel VEGF receptor that modulates VEGF binding to KDR and subsequent bioactivity and therefore may regulate VEGF-induced angiogenesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a mitogen for endothelial cells, and it promotes angiogenesis in vivo. Here we report that VEGF(165) has neurotrophic actions on cultured adult mouse superior cervical ganglia (SCG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), measured as axonal outgrowth. Maximal effect was observed at 10-50 ng/ml for SCG and 100 ng/ml for DRG. VEGF-induced axonal outgrowth was inhibited by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD 98059 but not by the protein kinase inhibitor K252a. VEGF also increased survival of both neurons and satellite cells and the number of proliferating Schwann cells. Immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting revealed that VEGF was expressed in virtually all nerve cells in the SCG but only in a population of small-diameter (<35 micrometers) neurons representing approximately 30\% of the neurons in DRG. Immunostaining showed that the VEGF receptor fetal liver kinase receptor (flk-1) was found on nerve cell bodies in DRG and to a lesser extent on neurons in SCG. Growth cones of regenerating axons from both types of ganglia exhibited flk-1 immunoreactivity, as did Schwann cells.

Here we used in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to study the VEGF receptor flk-1 in cultured superior cervical ganglia (SCG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from adult mice, and also the effects of VEGF on regeneration in vitro. Neurons in both ganglia contained the flk-1 receptor and showed an increased mRNA expression and immunoreactivity for flk-1 after 48 h in culture. In SCG, but not in DRG, double immunostaining for flk-1 and VEGF revealed coexpression in many neurons, implying that VEGF may exert both autocrine and paracrine actions. One proportion of the flk-1-positive neurons in DRG stained positive for the large neuron marker RT97 and another proportion expressed calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Small IB4-positive neurons were devoid of flk-1 immunoreactivity. Most flk-1-positive neurons in the DRG, but not in the SCG, were also immunoreactive to neuropilin-1. VEGF was found to stimulate axonal outgrowth from DRG, both by an action on the growing axons and the nerve cell bodies. The latter effect could be mediated by retrograde axonal transport as revealed by the use of a two compartment system to assay axonal outgrowth. We also found that the VEGF-induced axonal outgrowth was blocked by the flk-1 inhibitor SU5416. The results strongly suggest that VEGF acts as a neurotrophic factor and plays an important role during the regeneration of peripheral nerves.},

  Abstract                 = {Membrane currents in cultured murine oligodendrocytes and their precursors were characterized using the patch-clamp technique. Prior to recording, cells were identified by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies characteristic of two types of precursor cells and two differentiation stages of oligodendrocytes. The most immature, A2B5 antigen-positive glial precursors, expressed four types of voltage-activated K+ currents and tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ currents. The more differentiated cells, O4 antigen-positive glial precursors, expressed similar K+ currents, but Na+ currents were recorded in only a minority of cells. In differentiated O1 and O10 antigen-positive oligodendrocytes the channels characteristic of precursor cells were no longer observed, but an inwardly rectifying K+ current was apparent. Thus, channel expression by cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage correlates with differentiation stage and is more complex in precursor cells than in oligodendrocytes.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of high numerical aperture immersion lenses in optical microscopy is compromised by spherical aberrations induced by the refractive index mismatch between the immersion system and the embedding medium of the sample. Especially when imaging >10 micro m deep into the specimen, the refractive index mismatch results in a noticeable loss of image brightness and resolution. A solution to this problem is to adapt the index of the embedding medium to that of the immersion system. Unfortunately, not many mounting media are known that are both index tunable as well as compatible with fluorescence imaging. Here we introduce a nontoxic embedding medium, 2,2'-thiodiethanol (TDE), which, by being miscible with water at any ratio, allows fine adjustment of the average refractive index of the sample ranging from that of water (1.33) to that of immersion oil (1.52). TDE thus enables high resolution imaging deep inside fixed specimens with objective lenses of the highest available aperture angles and has the potential to render glycerol embedding redundant. The refractive index changes due to larger cellular structures, such as nuclei, are largely compensated. Additionally, as an antioxidant, TDE preserves the fluorescence quantum yield of most of the fluorophores. We present the optical and chemical properties of this new medium as well as its application to a variety of differently stained cells and cellular substructures.},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of ruthenium red (RuR) were tested on the membrane currents of internally perfused, voltage-clamped nerve cell bodies from the snail Limnea stagnalis. Bath application of nanomolar concentrations of RuR produces a prolonged Na current that decays approximately 40 times slower than the normal Na current in these cells. The relationship between the reversal potential for the prolonged Na current and the intracellular concentration of Na+ agrees well with the constant-field equation, assuming a small permeability for Cs+. Because a strong correlation was found between the magnitude of the normal Na current and that of the prolonged Na current, it is concluded that the prolonged Na current flows through the normal Na channels. This conclusion is supported by the similar selectivities, voltage dependencies, and tetrodotoxin (TTX) sensitivities of these two currents. This action of RuR to slow the inactivation of the Na channel was not observed at concentrations below 1 nM, but was complete at 10 nM. When the concentration of RuR is increased to 0.1 mM, the Ca current in these cells is blocked; but at this high concentration RuR also reduces the outward voltage-dependent currents and resting membrane resistance. Therefore, RuR is not a good Ca blocker because of its lack of specificity. However, its action of slowing Na current inactivation is very specific and could prove to be useful in studying the inactivation of the Na channel.},

The activity of the ubiquitously expressed NHE1 isoform of the plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger is one of the requirements for directed locomotion of migrating cells and also contributes to cell adhesion. The mechanisms by which NHE1 is involved in cell migration are multiple. NHE1 contributes to cell migration by affecting the cell volume, by regulating the intracellular pH and thereby the assembly and activity of cytoskeletal elements, by anchoring the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, by signalling, by regulating gene expression and by controlling cell adhesion. The present article gives a review of the different ways in which NHE1 is involved in and contributes to cell migration. These different mechanisms complement one another forming an intricate, integrative process.},

  Abstract                 = {Open pores to maintain nutrient diffusion and waste removal after cell colonization are crucial for the successful application of constructs based on assembled membranes, in our case tubular scaffolds made of ɛ-polycaprolactone (PCL), for use in tissue engineering. Due to the complex three-dimensional structure and large size of such scaffolds needed for transplantable tissues, it is difficult to investigate the cell-pore interactions in situ. Therefore miniaturized bioreactors inside Petri dishes (30 mm in diameter), containing porous PCL or poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes, were developed to allow the interactions of different cells with defined pores to be investigated in situ during both static and perfusion cultures. Investigation of two different cell types (fibroblasts and cortical astrocytes) and how they interact with a range of pores (100-350 μm in diameter) for up to 50 days indicated that the cells either 'covered' or 'bridged' the pores. Three distinct behaviors were observed in the way cortical astrocytes interacted with pores, while fibroblasts were able to quickly bridge the pores based on consistent "joint efforts". Our studies demonstrate that the distinct pore sealing behaviors of both cell types were influenced by pore size, initial cell density and culture period, but not by medium perfusion within the range of shear forces investigated. These findings form important basic data about the usability of pores within scaffolds that could inform the design and fabrication of suitable scaffolds for various applications in tissue engineering.},

VEGF confers neuroprotection and promotes neurogenesis and cerebral angiogenesis, but the manner in which these effects may interact in the ischemic brain is poorly understood. We produced focal cerebral ischemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 90 minutes in the adult rat brain and measured infarct size, neurological function, BrdU labeling of neuroproliferative zones, and vWF-immunoreactive vascular profiles, without and with intracerebroventricular administration of VEGF on days 1-3 of reperfusion. VEGF reduced infarct size, improved neurological performance, enhanced the delayed survival of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone, and stimulated angiogenesis in the striatal ischemic penumbra, but not the dentate gyrus. We conclude that in the ischemic brain VEGF exerts an acute neuroprotective effect, as well as longer latency effects on survival of new neurons and on angiogenesis, and that these effects appear to operate independently. VEGF may, therefore, improve histological and functional outcome from stroke through multiple mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Growth cones are highly motile structures at the end of neuronal processes, capable of receiving multiple types of guidance cues and transducing them into directed axonal growth. Thus, to guide the axon toward the appropriate target cell, the growth cone carries out different functions: it acts as a sensor, signal transducer, and motility device. An increasing number of molecular components that mediate axon guidance have been characterized over the past years. The vast majority of these molecules include proteins that act as guidance cues and their respective receptors. In addition, more and more signaling and cytoskeleton-associated proteins have been localized to the growth cone. Furthermore, it has become evident that growth cone motility and guidance depends on a dynamic cytoskeleton that is regulated by incoming guidance information. Current and future research in the growth cone field will be focussed on how different guidance cues transmit their signals to the cytoskeleton and change its dynamic properties to affect the rate and direction of growth cone movement. In this review, we discuss recent evidence that cell adhesion molecules can regulate growth cone motility and guidance by a mechanism of substrate-cytoskeletal coupling.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic microtubules explore the peripheral (P) growth cone domain using F actin bundles as polymerization guides. Microtubule dynamics are necessary for growth cone guidance; however, mechanisms of microtubule reorganization during growth cone turning are not well understood. Here, we address these issues by analyzing growth cone steering events in vitro, evoked by beads derivatized with the Ig superfamily cell adhesion protein apCAM. Pharmacological inhibition of microtubule assembly with low doses of taxol or vinblastine resulted in rapid clearance of microtubules from the P domain with little effect on central (C) axonal microtubules or actin-based motility. Early during target interactions, we detected F actin assembly and activated Src, but few microtubules, at apCAM bead binding sites. The majority of microtubules extended toward bead targets after F actin flow attenuation occurred. Microtubule extension during growth cone steering responses was strongly suppressed by dampening microtubule dynamics with low doses of taxol or vinblastine. These treatments also inhibited growth cone turning responses, as well as focal actin assembly and accumulation of active Src at bead binding sites. These results suggest that dynamic microtubules carry signals involved in regulating Src-dependent apCAM adhesion complexes involved in growth cone steering.},

  Abstract                 = {Stem cells, that is, cells that can both reproduce themselves and differentiate into functional cell types, attract much interest as potential aids to healing and disease therapy. Embryonic neural crest is pluripotent and generates the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, and some connective tissues. Neural-crest-related stem cells have been reported previously in postnatal skin: committed melanocytic stem cells in the hair follicle, and pluripotent cell types from the hair follicle and papilla that can produce various sets of lineages. Here we describe novel pluripotent neural crest-like stem cells from neonatal mouse epidermis, with different potencies, isolated as 3 independent immortal lines. Using alternative regulatory factors, they could be converted to large numbers of either Schwann precursor cells, pigmented melanocytes, chondrocytes, or functional sensory neurons showing voltage-gated sodium channels. Some of the neurons displayed abundant active TRPV1 and TRPA1 receptors. Such functional neurons have previously been obtained in culture only with difficulty, by explantation. The system was also used to generate comparative gene expression data for the stem cells, melanocytes, and melanoblasts that sufficiently explain the lack of pigment in melanoblasts and provide a rationale for some genes expressed apparently ectopically in melanomas, such as ephrin receptors.},

  Abstract                 = {We have investigated the spatial control of actin polymerization in fibroblasts using rhodamine-labeled muscle actin in; (a) microinjection experiments to follow actin dynamics in intact cells, and (b) incubation with permeabilized cells to study incorporation sites. Rhodamine-actin was microinjected into NIH-3T3 cells which were then fixed and stained with fluorescein-phalloidin to visualize total actin filaments. The incorporation of newly polymerized actin was assayed using rhodamine/fluorescein ratio-imaging. The results indicated initial incorporation of the injected actin near the tip and subsequent transport towards the base of lamellipodia at rates greater than 4.5 microns/min. Furthermore, both fluorescein- and rhodamine-intensity profiles across lamellipodia revealed a decreasing density of actin filaments from tip to base. From this observation and the presence of centripetal flux of polymerized actin we infer that the actin cytoskeleton partially disassembles before it reaches the base of the lamellipodium. In permeabilized cells we found that, in agreement with the injection studies, rhodamine-actin incorporated predominantly in a narrow strip of less than 1-microns wide, located at the tip of lamellipodia. The critical concentration for the rhodamine-actin incorporation (0.15 microM) and its inhibition by CapZ, a barbed-end capping protein, indicated that the nucleation sites for actin polymerization most likely consist of free barbed ends of actin filaments. Because any potential monomer-sequestering system is bypassed by addition of exogenous rhodamine-actin to the permeabilized cells, these observations indicate that the localization of actin incorporation in intact cells is determined, at least in part, by the presence of specific elongation and/or nucleation sites at the tips of lamellipodia and not solely by localized desequestration of subunits. We propose that the availability of the incorporation sites at the tips of lamellipodia is because of capping activities which preferentially inhibit barbed-end incorporation elsewhere in the cell, but leave barbed ends at the tips of lamellipodia free to add subunits.},

To avoid contact between the pipette tip and cells during the conventional lateral scanning mode, we adopted a standing approach (STA) mode in which the probe was moved vertically to first approach and then retracted from the cell surface at each measurement point on an XY plane. The STA mode ensured non-contact imaging of the topography of live cells and for a wide range of uneven substrates (500 x 300 microm to 5 x 5 microm). We also used a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board to enhance feedback distance regulation. FPGA dramatically increased the feedback speed and decreased the imaging time (450 s per image) with enhanced accuracy and quality of live cell images. To evaluate the potential of the STA mode for SICM, we carried out imaging of a convoluted surface of live cell in various scan ranges and estimated the spatial resolutions of these images.},

This was achieved by switching the applied voltage so as to change the faradaic current from a hindered diffusion feedback signal (for distance control and topographical imaging) to the electrochemical flux measurement of interest. This imaging method is robust, and a single nanoscale SECM electrode, which is simple to produce, is used for both topography and activity measurements. In order to minimize the delay at voltage switching, we used pyrolytic carbon nanoelectrodes with 6.5-100 nm radii that rapidly reached a steady-state current, typically in less than 20 ms for the largest electrodes and faster for smaller electrodes. In addition, these carbon nanoelectrodes are suitable for convoluted cell topography imaging because the RG value (ratio of overall probe diameter to active electrode diameter) is typically in the range of 1.5-3.0. We first evaluated the resolution of constant-current mode topography imaging using carbon nanoelectrodes. Next, we performed VSM-SECM measurements to visualize membrane proteins on A431 cells and to detect neurotransmitters from a PC12 cells. We also combined VSM-SECM with surface confocal microscopy to allow simultaneous fluorescence and topographical imaging. VSM-SECM opens up new opportunities in nanoscale chemical mapping at interfaces, and should find wide application in the physical and biological sciences.},

Characterization of the probe was performed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and approach curve measurements. SECM/SICM was applied to simultaneous imaging of topography and electrochemical responses of enzymes (horse radish peroxidase (HRP) and glucose oxidase (GOD)) and single live cells (A6 cells, superior cervical ganglion (SCG) cells, and cardiac myocytes). The measurements revealed the distribution of activity of the enzyme spots on uneven surfaces with submicrometer resolution.

  abstract    = {Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) is a scanning probe technique that allows investigating surfaces of complex, convoluted samples such as living cells with minimal impairment. This technique monitors the ionic current through the small opening of an electrolyte-filled micro- or nanopipet that is approached toward a sample, submerged in an electrolyte. The conductance drops in a strongly distance-dependent manner. For SICM imaging, the assumption is made that positions of equal conductance changes correspond to equal tip-sample distances and thus can be utilized to reconstruct the sample surface. Here, we examined this assumption by investigating experimental approach curves toward silicone droplets, as well as finite element modeling of the imaging process. We found that the assumption is strictly true only for perpendicular approaches toward a horizontal sample and otherwise overestimates the sample height by up to several pipet opening radii. We developed a method to correct this overestimation and applied it to correct images of fixed cellular structures and living entire cells.},

Therefore, we performed live-recording studies of the green fluorescent protein-tagged neurofilament M (GFP-NF-M) to assay transport processes in neurons. Co-localization studies revealed that GFP-NF-M was capable to build a functional NF network with other NF subunits, including phosphorylated heavy neurofilaments (NF-H-PH). Time-lapse recordings using confocal laser scanning microscopy exhibited fast transport of NF dots in anterograde and retrograde direction through a photobleached gap. Following microinjection of anti-kinesin antibodies or colchicine treatment an impairment of anterograde as well as retrograde NF transport was observed during live-recording experiments. In contrast, microinjection of anti-dynein antibodies only impaired retrograde transport of NF whereas the anterograde movement of GFP-NF-M was unaffected. Treatment of the cells with unspecific antibodies had no effect.},

  Abstract                 = {NG2 cells originate from various brain regions and migrate to their destinations during early development. These cells express voltage-gated Na(+) channels but fail to produce typical action potentials. The physiological role of Na(+) channels in these cells is unclear. We found that GABA induces membrane depolarization and Ca(2+) elevation in NG2 cells, a process requiring activation of GABA(A) receptors, Na(+) channels, and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers (NCXs), but not Ca(2+) channels. We have identified a persistent Na(+) current in these cells that may underlie the GABA-induced pathway of prolonged Na(+) elevation, which in turn triggers Ca(2+) influx via NCXs. This unique Ca(2+) signaling pathway is further shown to be involved in the migration of NG2 cells. Thus, GABAergic signaling mediated by sequential activation of GABA(A) receptors, noninactivating Na(+) channels, and NCXs may play an important role in the development and function of NG2 glial cells in the brain.},

Each affords unique strengths in lateral and axial resolution, speed, sensitivity, and fluorophore compatibility. We examine the optical principles and design of these new instruments and their ability to see more detail with greater sensitivity--down to single molecules with tens of nanometers resolution. Nanoscopes have revealed transient intermediate states of organelles and molecules in living cells and have led to new discoveries but also biological controversies. We highlight common unifying principles behind nanoscopy such as the conversion of a subset of probes between states (ground or excited) and the use of scanning (ordered or stochastic). We emphasize major advances, biological applications, and promising new developments.},

Nucleokinesis appears to require many of the same cytoskeletal and signaling molecules used in cell mitosis. Converging studies suggest it requires cytoplasmic dynein, cell polarity genes, and microtubule-associated proteins that coordinate microtubule remodeling. These coordinate first the positioning of the centrosome (microtubule organizing center) in the leading process in front of the nucleus and then the movement of the nucleus towards the centrosome. The positioning of the centrosome and the dynamic regulation that couples and uncouples the nucleus underlies directed migration of neurons.},

  Abstract                 = {Seven-color analyses of immunofluorescence-stained tissue samples were accomplished using Fourier spectroscopy-based hyperspectral imaging and singular value decomposition. This system consists of a combination of seven fluorescent dyes, three filtersets, an epifluorescence microscope, a spectral imaging system, a computer for data acquisition, and data analysis software. The spectra of all pixels in a multicolor image were taken simultaneously using a Sagnac type interferometer. The spectra were deconvolved to estimate the contribution of each component dye, and individual dye images were constructed based on the intensities of assigned signals. To obtain mixed spectra, three filter sets, i.e., Bl, Gr, and Rd for Alexa488 and Alexa532, for Alexa546, Alexa568, and Alexa594, and for Cy5 and Cy5.5, respectively, were used for simultaneous excitation of two or three dyes. These fluorophores have considerable spectral overlap which precludes their separation by conventional analysis. We resolved their relative contributions to the fluorescent signal by a method involving linear unmixing based on singular value decomposition of the matrices consisting of dye spectra. Analyses of mouse thymic tissues stained with seven different fluorescent dyes provided clear independent images, and any combination of two or three individual dye images could be used for constructing multicolor images.},

  Abstract                 = {The present study was designed to show the applicability of scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) for imaging different types of biological samples. For this purpose, we first applied SICM to image collagen fibrils and showed the usefulness of the approach-retract scanning (ARS)/hopping mode for such samples with steep slopes. Comparison of SICM images with those obtained by AFM revealed that the ARS/hopping SICM mode can probe the surface topography of collagen fibrils and chromosomes at nanoscale resolution under liquid conditions. In addition, we successfully imaged cultured HeLa cells, with 15 μm in height by ARS/hopping SICM mode. Because SICM can obtain non-contact (or force-free) images, delicate cellular projections were visualized on the surface of the fixed cell. SICM imaging of live HeLa cells further demonstrated its applicability to study the morphological dynamics associated with biological processes on the time scale of minutes under liquid conditions. We further applied SICM for imaging the luminal surface of the trachea and succeeded in visualizing the surface of both ciliated and non-ciliated cells. These SICM images were comparable with those obtained by scanning electron microscopy. Although the dynamic mode of AFM provides better resolution than the ARS/hopping mode of SICM in some samples, only the latter can obtain contact-free images of samples with steep slopes, rendering it an important tool for observing live cells as well as unfixed or fixed soft samples with complicated shapes. Taken together, we demonstrate that SICM imaging, especially using an ARS/hopping mode, is a useful technique with unique capabilities for imaging the three-dimensional topography of a range of biological samples under physiologically relevant aqueous conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {The labeling of cells with fluorescent nanoparticles is promising for various biomedical applications. The objective of this study is to evaluate the biocompatibility and the mechanism of the cellular uptake of fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) in cancer cells (HeLa) and pre-adipocytes (3T3-L1). With flow cytometry and the use of a battery of metabolic and cytoskeletal inhibitors, we found that the mechanism of the FND uptake in both cells is by energy-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In addition, the surface charge of FND influences its cellular uptake, as the uptake of poly-L-lysine-coated FNDs is better than that of oxidative-acid-purified FNDs at the same concentration in regular medium with or without serum. We also confirm that the proliferative potential of FND-treated and untreated cells does not exhibit any significant differences when measured at bulk cultures, and more stringently at clonal cell density. Further biocompatibility studies indicate that the in vitro differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and 489-2 osteoprogenitors is not affected by the FND treatment. Our results show that FNDs are biocompatible and ideal candidates for potential applications in human stem cell research.},

  abstract    = {We examined the effects of the adipose hormone leptin on the development of mouse cortical neurons. Treatment of neonatal and adult mice with intraperitoneal leptin (5 mg/kg) induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation in pyriform and entorhinal cortex neurons. Stimulation of cultured embryonic cortical neurons with leptin evoked Janus kinase 2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activated the downstream effector 90-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase. Moreover, leptin elicited the phosphorylation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase effector Akt and evoked Ser-9 phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta), an event inactivating this kinase. Leptin-mediated GSK3beta phosphorylation was prevented by the MEK/ERK inhibitor PD98059, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, or the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X. Exposure of cortical neurons to leptin also induced Ser-41 phosphorylation of the neuronal growth-associated protein GAP-43, an effect prevented by LY294002 and GF109203X but not by PD98059. Ser-41-GAP-43 phosphorylation is usually high in expanding axonal growth cones. Neurons exposed to 100 ng/ml leptin for 72 h displayed reduced rate of growth cone collapse, a shift of growth cone size distribution toward higher values, and a 4-fold increase in mean growth cone surface area compared with control cultures. The leptin-induced growth cone spreading was hampered in cortical neurons from Lepr(db/db) mice lacking functional leptin receptors; it was associated with localized Ser-9-GSK3beta phosphorylation and mimicked by the GSK3beta inhibitor SB216763. At concentrations preventing GSK3beta phosphorylation, PD98059, LY294002, or GF109203X reversed the leptin-induced growth cone surface enlargement. We concluded that the leptin-mediated regulation of growth cone morphogenesis in cortical neurons relies on upstream regulators of GSK3beta activity.},

  Abstract                 = {Phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane has been proposed to locally regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Indeed, recent studies that use GFP-tagged pleckstrin homology domains (GFP-PH) as fluorescent PIP(2) sensors suggest that this lipid is enriched in membrane microdomains. Here we report that this concept needs revision. Using three distinct fluorescent GFP-tagged pleckstrin homology domains, we show that highly mobile GFP-PH patches colocalize perfectly with various lipophilic membrane dyes and, hence, represent increased lipid content rather than PIP(2)-enriched microdomains. We show that bright patches are caused by submicroscopical folds and ruffles in the membrane that can be directly visualized at approximately 15 nm axial resolution with a novel numerically enhanced imaging method. F-actin motility is inhibited significantly by agonist-induced PIP(2) breakdown, and it resumes as soon as PIP(2) levels are back to normal. Thus, our data support a role for PIP(2) in the regulation of cortical actin, but they challenge a model in which spatial differences in PIP(2) regulation of the cytoskeleton exist at a micrometer scale.},

Moreover, cofilin activity is implicated in the malignant, invasive properties of cancer cells. The effects of ADF/cofilins on actin dynamics are diverse and their regulation is complex. In stimulated cells, multiple signalling pathways can be initiated resulting in different activation/deactivation switches that control ADF/cofilin activity. The output of this entire regulatory system, in combination with spatial and temporal segregation of the activation mechanisms, underlies the contribution of ADF/cofilins to various cell migration/invasion phenotypes. In this framework, we describe current views on how ADF/cofilins function in migrating and invading cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Functional and molecular analysis of glial voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels underwent tremendous boost over the last 15 years. The traditional image of the glial cell as a passive, structural element of the nervous system was transformed into the concept of a plastic cell, capable of expressing a large variety of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors. These molecules might enable glial cells to sense neuronal activity and to integrate it within glial networks, e.g., by means of spreading calcium waves. In this review we shall give a comprehensive summary of the main functional properties of ion channels and ionotropic receptors expressed by macroglial cells, i.e., by astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. In particular we will discuss in detail glial sodium, potassium and anion channels, as well as glutamate, GABA and ATP activated ionotropic receptors. A majority of available data was obtained from primary cell culture, these results have been compared with corresponding studies that used acute tissue slices or freshly isolated cells. In view of these data, an active glial participation in information processing seems increasingly likely and a physiological role for some of the glial channels and receptors is gradually emerging.},

  Abstract                 = {TRPV4 belongs to the TRPV subfamily of Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channels. This year marks the 10 year anniversary of the discovery of this polymodal ion channel which is activated by a variety of stimuli including warm temperatures, hypotonicity and endogenous lipids. Coupled with a widespread tissue distribution, this activation profile has resulted in a large number of disparate physiological functions for TRPV4. These range from temperature monitoring in skin keratinocytes to osmolarity sensing in kidneys, sheer stress detection in blood vessels and osteoclast differentiation control in bone. As knowledge of its physiological roles has expanded, interest in targeting TRPV4 modulation for therapeutic purposes has arisen and is now focused on several areas. First, as with related TRP channels TRPV1, TRPV3, TRPM8 and TRPA1, TRPV4 antagonism is being considered for inflammatory and neuropathic pain treatment. Recent work conducted using KO mice and agonists 4αPDD and GSK1016790A suggests bladder dysfunctions may also be targeted. Additionally, ventilator-induced lung injury has emerged as another potential indication for TRPV4 antagonists. Herein we review the known small molecule modulators of TRPV4 and relate progress made in identifying potent, selective and bioavailable agonists and antagonists to interrogate this ion channel in vivo.},

  Abstract                 = {Doping of carbon nanoparticles with impurity atoms is central to their application. However, doping has proven elusive for very small carbon nanoparticles because of their limited availability and a lack of fundamental understanding of impurity stability in such nanostructures. Here, we show that isolated diamond nanoparticles as small as 1.6 nm, comprising only ∼400 carbon atoms, are capable of housing stable photoluminescent colour centres, namely the silicon vacancy (SiV). Surprisingly, fluorescence from SiVs is stable over time, and few or only single colour centres are found per nanocrystal. We also observe size-dependent SiV emission supported by quantum-chemical simulation of SiV energy levels in small nanodiamonds. Our work opens the way to investigating the physics and chemistry of molecular-sized cubic carbon clusters and promises the application of ultrasmall non-perturbative fluorescent nanoparticles as markers in microscopy and sensing.},

  Abstract                 = {Using patch clamp and Ca(2+) imaging techniques, we have studied Ca(2+) entry pathways in human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells. These cells express the mRNA of TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3 and TRPV4 channels, but not those of TRPV5 and TRPV6. Functional assessment showed that capsaicin (10 microM), 4alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (4alphaPDD, 1 microM), arachidonic acid (10 microM), hypotonic stress, and heat all stimulated increases in [Ca(2+)](i) within minutes. The increase in [Ca(2+)](i) depended on extracellular Ca(2+) and on the transmembrane potential, which indicated that both driving forces affected Ca(2+) entry. Capsaicin also stimulated an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) in nominally Ca(2+)-free solutions, which was compatible with the receptor functioning as a Ca(2+) release channel. Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) modulated Ca(2+) entry. Ca(2+) influx was greater in HepG2 cells incubated with HGF/SF (20 ng/ml for 20 h) compared with non-stimulated cells, but this occurred only in those cells with a migrating phenotype as determined by presence of a lamellipodium and trailing footplate. The effect of capsaicin on [Ca(2+)](i) was greater in migrating HGF/SF-treated cells, and this was inhibited by capsazepine. The difference between control and HGF/SF-treated cells was not found in Ca(2+)-free solutions. 4alphaPDD also had no greater effect on HGF/SF-treated cells. We conclude that TRPV1 and TRPV4 channels provide Ca(2+) entry pathways in HepG2 cells. HGF/SF increases Ca(2+) entry via TRPV1, but not via TRPV4. This rise in [Ca(2+)](i) may constitute an early response of a signalling cascade that gives rise to cell locomotion and the migratory phenotype.},

  Abstract                 = {Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) has been found to be expressed by endothelial cells and tumor cells as an isoform-specific receptor for vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Previous studies were mainly focused on the extracellular domain of NRP-1 that can bind to VEGF165 and, thus, enables NRP-1 to act as a co-receptor for VEGF165, which enhances its binding to VEGFR-2 and its bioactivity. However, the exact functional roles and related signaling mechanisms of NRP-1 in angiogenesis are not well understood. In this study we constructed a chimeric receptor, EGNP-1, by fusing the extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of NRP-1 and transduced it into HUVECs with a retroviral expression vector. We observed that NRP-1/EGNP-1 mediates ligand-stimulated migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) but not proliferation. Our results show that NRP-1 alone can mediate HUVEC migration through its intracellular domain, and its C-terminal three amino acids (SEA-COOH) are essential for the process. We demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor Ly294002 and the p85 dominant negative mutant can block NRP-1-mediated HUVEC migration. NRP-1-mediated migration can be significantly reduced by overexpression of the dominant negative mutant of RhoA (RhoA-19N). In addition, Gq family proteins and Gbetagamma subunits are also required for NRP-1-mediated HUVEC migration. These results show for the first time that NRP-1 can independently promote cell signaling in endothelial cells and also demonstrate the importance of last three amino acids of NRP-1 for its function.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous observations indicated that the lamellipodium ("leading edge") of fibroblasts contains a dense meshwork, as well as numerous bundles (microspikes) of actin filaments. Most, if not all, of the filaments have a uniform polarity, with the "barbed" end associated with the membrane. I investigated whether and how actin subunits exchange in this region by microinjecting living gerbil fibroma cells (IMR-33) with actin that had been labeled with iodoacetamidotetramethylrhodamine. After incorporation of the labeled actin into the lamellipodium, I used a laser microbeam to photobleach a 3-4-micron region at and surrounding a microspike, without disrupting the integrity of the structure. I then recorded the pattern of fluorescence recovery and analyzed it using a combination of TV image intensification and digital image processing techniques. Fluorescence recovery was first detected near the edge of the cell and then moved toward the cell's center at a constant rate of 0.79 +/- 0.31 micron/min. When only part of the lamellipodium near the edge of the cell was photobleached, the bleached spot also moved toward the cell's center and through an area unbleached by the laser beam. These results indicated that steady state incorporation of actin subunits occurred predominantly at the membrane-associated end of actin filaments, and that actin subunits in the lamellipodium underwent a constant movement toward the center of the cell. I suggest that treadmilling, possibly in combination with other molecular interactions, may provide an effective mechanism for the movement of actin subunits and the protrusion of cytoplasm in the lamellipodium of fibroblasts.},

  Abstract                 = {Cell migration relies on a tight temporal and spatial regulation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). [Ca2+]i in turn depends on Ca2+ influx via channels in the plasma membrane whose molecular nature is still largely unknown for migrating cells. A mechanosensitive component of the Ca2+ influx pathway was suggested. We show here that the capsaicin-sensitive transient receptor potential channel TRPV1, that plays an important role in pain transduction, is one of the Ca2+ influx channels involved in cell migration. Activating TRPV1 channels with capsaicin leads to an acceleration of human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells pretreated with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The speed rises by up to 50\% and the displacement is doubled. Patch clamp experiments revealed the presence of capsaicin and resiniferatoxin (RTX)-sensitive currents. In contrast, HepG2 cells kept in the absence of HGF are not accelerated by capsaicin and express no capsaicin- or RTX-sensitive current. The TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine prevents the stimulation of migration and inhibits capsaicin-sensitive currents. Finally, we compared the contribution of capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1 channels to cell migration with that of mechanosensitive TRPV4 channels that are also expressed in HepG2 cells. A specific TRPV4 agonist, 4alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, does not increase the displacement. In summary, we assigned a novel role to capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1 channels. They are important Ca2+ influx channels required for cell migration.},

  Abstract                 = {We studied the ionic mechanisms underlying the regulatory volume increase of rat hepatocytes in primary culture by use of confocal laser scanning microscopy, conventional and ion-sensitive microelectrodes, cable analysis, microfluorometry, and measurements of 86Rb+ uptake. Increasing osmolarity from 300 to 400 mosm/liter by addition of sucrose decreased cell volumes to 88.6\% within 1 min; thereafter, cell volumes increased to 94.1\% of control within 10 min, equivalent to a regulatory volume increase (RVI) by 44.5\%. This RVI was paralleled by a decrease in cell input resistance and in specific cell membrane resistance to 88 and 60\%, respectively. Ion substitution experiments (high K+, low Na+, low Cl-) revealed that these membrane effects are due to an increase in hepatocyte Na+ conductance. During RVI, ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake was augmented to 141\% of control, and cell Na+ and cell K+ increased to 148 and 180\%, respectively. The RVI, the increases in Na+ conductance and cell Na+, as well as the activation of Na+/K(+)-ATPase were completely blocked by 10(-5) mol/liter amiloride. At this concentration, amiloride had no effect on osmotically induced cell alkalinization via Na+/H+ exchange. When osmolarity was increased from 220 to 300 mosm/liter (by readdition of sucrose after a preperiod of 15 min in which the cells underwent a regulatory volume decrease, RVD) cell volumes initially decreased to 81.5\%; thereafter cell volumes increased to 90.8\% of control. This post-RVD-RVI of 55.0\% is also mediated by an increase in Na+ conductance. We conclude that rat hepatocytes in confluent primary culture are capable of RVI as well as of post-RVD-RVI. In this system, hypertonic stress leads to a considerable increase in cell membrane Na+ conductance. In concert with conductive Na+ influx, cell K+ is then increased via activation of Na+/K(+)-ATPase. An additional role of Na+/H+ exchange in the volume regulation of rat hepatocytes remains to be defined.},

  Abstract                 = {1. In rat hepatocytes under hypertonic stress, the entry of Na+ (which is thereafter exchanged for K+ via Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase) plays the key role in regulatory volume increase (RVI). 2. In the present study, the contributions of Na+ conductance, Na(+)-H+ exchange and Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- symport to this process were quantified in confluent primary cultures by means of intracellular microelectrodes and cable analysis, microfluorometric determinations of cell pH and buffer capacity, and measurements of frusemide (furosemide)/bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake, respectively. Osmolarity was increased from 300 to 400 mosmol l-1 by addition of sucrose. 3. The experiments indicate a relative contribution of approximately 4:1:1 to hypertonicity-induced Na+ entry for the above-mentioned transporters and the overall Na+ yield equalled 51 mmol l-1 (10 min)-1. 4. This Na+ gain is in good agreement with the stimulation of Na+ extrusion via Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase plus the actual increase in cell Na+, namely 55 mmol l-1 (10 min)-1, as we determined on the basis of ouabain-sensitive 86Rb+ uptake and by means of Na(+)-sensitive microelectrodes, respectively. 5. The overall increase in Na+ and K+ activity plus the expected concomitant increase in cell Cl- equalled 68 mmol l-1, which fits well with the increase in osmotic activity expected to occur from an initial cell shrinkage to 87.5\% and a RVI to 92.6\% of control, namely 53 mosmol l-1. 6. The prominent role of Na+ conductance in the RVI of rat hepatocytes could be confirmed on the basis of the pharmacological profile of this process, which was characterized by means of confocal laser-scanning microscopy.},

  Abstract                 = {Directional movement is a property common to all cell types during development and is critical to tissue remodelling and regeneration after damage. In migrating cells, calcium has a multifunctional role in directional sensing, cytoskeleton redistribution, traction force generation, and relocation of focal adhesions. Here we visualize high-calcium microdomains ('calcium flickers') and their patterned activation in migrating human embryonic lung fibroblasts. Calcium flicker activity is dually coupled to membrane tension (by means of TRPM7, a stretch-activated Ca(2+)-permeant channel of the transient receptor potential superfamily) and chemoattractant signal transduction (by means of type 2 inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors). Interestingly, calcium flickers are most active at the leading lamella of migrating cells, displaying a 4:1 front-to-rear polarization opposite to the global calcium gradient. When exposed to a platelet-derived growth factor gradient perpendicular to cell movement, asymmetric calcium flicker activity develops across the lamella and promotes the turning of migrating fibroblasts. These findings show how the exquisite spatiotemporal organization of calcium microdomains can orchestrate complex cellular processes such as cell migration.},

Harboring a myriad of calcium effector proteins, migrating cells display an exquisite multiscaled and multilayered architecture of intracellular calcium dynamics. In motile fibroblasts, for instance, there are transient calcium microdomains ('calcium flickers') of ~5 μm in diameter and 10-2000 ms in duration, a rising flicker activity gradient along the rear-to-front axis, and a shallow background calcium concentration gradient in the opposite direction. When subjected to external gradients of guidance cues, local flicker gradients are created de novo in the leading edge, which steer cells to turn in new directions as defined by the asymmetry of the flicker activity, apparently by a stochastic decision-making mechanism. These recent findings provide a glimpse into how spatiotemporally coordinated calcium gradients orchestrate cellular behavior as complex as directional movement.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the challenges and limitations that are encountered when studying membrane protein dynamics in vivo by means of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Based on theoretical arguments and computer simulations, we show that, in general, the fluctuating fluorescence has a fractal dimension D(0) >or= 1.5, which is determined by the anomality alpha of the diffusional motion of the labeled particles, i.e., by the growth of their mean square displacement as (Deltax)(2) approximately t(alpha). The fractality enforces an initial power-law behavior of the autocorrelation function and related quantities for small times. Using this information, we show by FCS that Golgi resident membrane proteins move subdiffusively in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus in vivo. Based on Monte Carlo simulations for FCS on curved surfaces, we can rule out that the observed anomalous diffusion is a result of the complex topology of the membrane. The apparent mobility of particles as determined by FCS, however, is shown to depend crucially on the shape of the membrane and its motion in time. Due to this fact, the hydrodynamic radius of the tracked particles can be easily overestimated by an order of magnitude.},

Abnormal activation of the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway has been shown to play a role in diseases such as hypertension and bronchial asthma.

VEGF(165) and VEGF(121) share similar affinities at the isolated VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 but have been previously demonstrated to have differential ability to activate VEGFR-2-mediated effects on endothelial cells. Herein we investigate whether the recently described VEGF(165) isoform-specific receptor neuropilin-1 (Npn-1) is responsible for the difference in potency observed for these ligands. We demonstrate that although VEGFR-2 and Npn-1 form a complex, this complex does not result in an increase in VEGF(165) binding affinity. Therefore, the differential activity of VEGF(165) and VEGF(121) cannot be explained by a differential binding affinity for the complex. Using an antagonist that competes for VEGF(165) binding at the VEGFR-2.Npn-1 complex, we observe specific antagonism of VEGF(165)-meditated phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 without affecting the VEGF(121) response. These data indicate that the formation of the complex is responsible for the increased potency of VEGF(165) versus VEGF(121). Taken together, these data suggest a receptor-clustering role for Npn-1, as opposed to Npn-1 behaving as an affinity-converting subunit.},

  Abstract                 = {Hypoxic preconditioning provides protection against ischemic brain lesions in animal models of cerebral ischemia-hypoxia. To analyze the underlying molecular mechanisms, we developed an in vitro model of hypoxic neuroprotection in cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) by reducing the oxygen tension to 1-5\% for 1-24 hr. Exposure to 5\% O2 for 9 hr resulted in reduction of cell death after potassium deprivation, treatment with 100 microm glutamate, or 500 microm 3-nitroproprioninc acid (3-NP) by 46, 22, and 55\%, respectively. Shorter (1 or 3 hr) or longer (>12 hr) intervals or pretreatment with lower oxygen tension failed to rescue CGN from death. In contrast, toxicity of four different chemotherapeutic drugs [1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea, cisplatine, topotecane, and vincristine] was unaffected by hypoxic preconditioning. The induction of protective effects was dependent on new protein synthesis. Protein levels of B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (BCL-2), BCL-x(L/S), heat shock protein 70/90, and BCL-2-associated death protein remained unaltered. CGN incubated at 5\% O2 for 9 hr showed increased levels of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), phosphorylated Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1). Incubation with a neutralizing anti-VEGF antibody, a monoclonal antibody to VEGFR-2, wortmannin, or antisense-Akt/PKB, but not treatment with U0126, an ERK-inhibitor, reverted the resistance acquired by hypoxic preconditioning. Inhibition of VEGFR-2 blocked the activation of Akt/PKB. Finally, pretreatment with recombinant VEGF resulted in a hypoxia-resistant phenotype in the absence of hypoxic preconditioning. Our data are indicating a sequential requirement for VEGF/VEGFR-2 activation and Akt/PKB phosphorylation for neuronal survival mediated by hypoxic preconditioning and propose VEGF as a hypoxia-induced neurotrophic factor.},

However, these primary neurons can be rescued by transfection of a b-raf expression plasmid. In contrast, c-raf-deficient neurons survive in response to neurotrophic factors, similarly to neurons from wild-type mice.

Operating at pulse repetition rates around 1 MHz, it also affords reduced photobleaching rates by allowing the fluorophore to relax from excitable metastable dark states involved in photodegradation. The imaging of dense nanoparticles and of the microtubular network of mammalian cells evidences a spatial resolution of 30-50 nm in the focal plane, i.e. by a factor of 8-9 beyond the diffraction barrier.},

  Abstract                 = {Obstetric cholestasis is a liver disease of pregnancy that can be complicated by sudden, hitherto unexplained, intra-uterine fetal death. Because intra-uterine death occurs suddenly, and because fetal heart rate abnormalities have been reported in obstetric cholestasis, we hypothesized that intra-uterine death is caused by impaired fetal cardiomyocyte function, resulting in fetal cardiac arrest. Obstetric cholestasis is associated with raised levels of maternal and fetal serum bile acids, and we propose that these may alter cardiomyocyte function. It was not possible to investigate the effects of bile acids on the intact human fetal heart at a cellular level. Therefore we used the closest available model of fetal myocardium at term: a primary culture of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in which cells beat synchronously and develop pacemaker activity. The effect of the primary bile acid taurocholate (0.3 mM and 3 mM) on cultures of single cardiomyocytes, each with its own independent rate of contraction, was a reversible decrease in the rate of contraction and in the proportion of beating cells (P < 0.001). Addition of taurocholate to a network of synchronously beating cells caused a similar decrease in the rate of contraction. Furthermore, the integrity of the network was destroyed, and cells ceased to beat synchronously. Taurocholate also resulted in altered calcium dynamics and loss of synchronous beating. These data suggest that raised levels of the bile acid taurocholate in the fetal serum in obstetric cholestasis may result in the development of a fetal dysrhythmia and in sudden intra-uterine death.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), cell proliferation, and cell dynamics in primary astrocytes. VEGF is known as a dimeric polypeptide that potentially binds to two receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, however many effects are mediated by VEGFR-2, for example, actin polymerization, forced cell migration, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation. Recently it has been shown that in case of hypoxia, ischemia or injury VEGF is upregulated to stimulate angiogenesis and cell proliferation. Besides this, VEGF reveals a potent therapeutical target for averting tumor vascularization, emerging in bevacizumab, the first humanized anti-VEGF-A antibody for treating recurrent Glioblastoma multiforme. To expand our knowledge about VEGF effects in glial cells, we cultivated rat astrocytes in medium containing VEGF for 1 and 2 days. To investigate the effects of VEGF on GJIC, we microinjected neurobiotin into a single cell and monitored dye-spreading into adjacent cells. These experiments showed that VEGF significantly enhances astrocytic GJIC compared with controls. Cell proliferation measured by BrdU-labeling also revealed a significant increase of astrocytic mitose rates subsequent to 1 day of VEGF exposure, whereas longer VEGF treatment for 2 days did not have additive effects. To study cell-dynamics of astrocytes subsequent to VEGF treatment, we additionally transfected astrocytes with LifeAct-RFP. Live-cell imaging and quantitative analysis of these cells with aid of confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed higher process movement of VEGF-treated astrocytes. In conclusion, VEGF strongly affects cell proliferation, GJIC, and motility in astrocytes.},

  Abstract                 = {Significant evidence has indicated that poly(L-lactide)-co-(ɛ-caprolactone) [(poly(LLA-co-CL)] scaffolds could be one of the suitable candidates for bone tissue engineering. Oxygen-terminated nanodiamond particles (n-DP) were combined with poly(LLA-co-CL) and revealed to be positive for cell growth. In this study, we evaluated the influence of poly(LLA-co-CL) scaffolds modified by n-DP on attachment, proliferation, differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in vitro, and on bone formation using a sheep calvarial defect model. BMSCs were seeded on either poly(LLA-co-CL)- or n-DP-coated scaffolds and incubated for 1 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence microscopy were used in addition to protein and DNA measurements to evaluate cellular attachment on the scaffolds. To determine the effect of n-DP on proliferation of BMSCs, cell/scaffold constructs were harvested after 3 days and evaluated by Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) protein assay and SEM. In addition, the osteogenic differentiation of cells grown for 2 weeks on the various scaffolds and in a dynamic culture condition was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. Unmodified and modified scaffolds were implanted into the calvaria of six-year-old sheep. The expression of collagen type I (COL I) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) after 4 weeks as well as the formation of new bone after 12 and 24 weeks were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and histology. Scaffolds modified with n-DP supported increased cell attachment and the mRNA expression of osteopontin (OPN), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and BMP-2 were significantly increased after 2 weeks of culture. The BMSCs had spread well on the various scaffolds investigated after 3 days in the study with no significant difference in cell proliferation. Furthermore, the in vivo data revealed more positive staining of COL I and BMP-2 in relation to the n-DP-coated scaffolds after 4 weeks and presented more bone formation after 12 and 24 weeks. n-DP modification significantly increased cell attachment and differentiation of BMSCs on poly(LLA-co-CL) scaffolds in vitro and enhanced bone formation in vivo.},

  abstract    = {Neuronal growth cones are motile structures located at the end of axons that translate extracellular guidance information into directional movements. Despite the important role of growth cones in neuronal development and regeneration, relatively little is known about the topography and mechanical properties of distinct subcellular growth cone regions under live conditions. In this study, we used the AFM to study the P domain, T zone, and C domain of live Aplysia growth cones. The average height of these regions was calculated from contact mode AFM images to be 183 +/- 33, 690 +/- 274, and 1322 +/- 164 nm, respectively. These findings are consistent with data derived from dynamic mode images of live and contact mode images of fixed growth cones. Nano-indentation measurements indicate that the elastic moduli of the C domain and T zone ruffling region ranged between 3-7 and 7-23 kPa, respectively. The range of the measured elastic modulus of the P domain was 10-40 kPa. High resolution images of the P domain suggest its relatively high elastic modulus results from a dense meshwork of actin filaments in lamellipodia and from actin bundles in the filopodia. The increased mechanical stiffness of the P and T domains is likely important to support and transduce tension that develops during growth cone steering.},

In this study, early responses of living human alveolar epithelial A549 cells after exposure to nZnO were investigated by noncontact hopping probe ion conductance microscopy (HPICM) that was combined with the patch-clamp technique. Continuous repetitive high-resolution HPICM scannings observed that 100 μg/mL nZnO treatment caused acute damage to A549 cell membrane within 1.5 h. Such membrane damage was reflected in a significantly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level in cell culture medium after 3 h of nZnO exposure. The combined HPICM and patch-clamp technique can easily perform whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, which demonstated that nZnO treatment even could inhibit the activities of ion channels in A549 cells within 15 min. The HPICM technique is shown to be capable of detecting the acute toxicity of nZnO on living cells in real time and helping to elucidate the mechanism of its action.},

These cells have been proved to be a useful cell model to study neuronal differentiation. NGF induces rapid changes in membrane morphology, neurite outgrowth, and electrical excitability. However, the relationship between the 3D morphological changes of NGF-differentiated PC12 cells and their electrophysiological functions remains poorly understood. In this study, we combined a recently developed Hopping Probe Ion Conductance Microscopy (HPICM) with patch-clamp technique to investigate the high-resolution morphological changes and functional ion-channel development during the NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. NGF enlarged TTX-sensitive sodium currents of PC12 cells, which associated with cell volume, membrane surface area, surface roughness of the membrane, and neurite outgrowth. These results demonstrate that the combination of HPICM and patch-clamp technique can provide detailed information of membrane microstructures and ion-channel functions during the differentiation of PC12 cells, and has the potential to become a powerful tool for neuronal research.},

  Abstract                 = {The formation of CNS myelin is dependent on the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and oligodendrocyte maturation. How the initiation of myelination is regulated is unclear, but it is likely to depend on the development of competence by oligodendrocytes and receptivity by target axons. Here we identify an additional level of control of oligodendrocyte maturation mediated by interactions between the different cellular components of the oligodendrocyte lineage. During development oligodendrocyte precursors mature through a series of stages defined by labeling with monoclonal antibodies A2B5 and O4. Newly differentiated oligodendrocytes begin to express galactocerebroside recognized by O1 antibodies and subsequently mature to myelin basic protein (MBP)-positive cells prior to formation of compact myelin. Using an in vitro brain slice culture system that supports robust myelination, the consequences of ablating cells at different stages of the oligodendrocyte lineage on myelination have been assayed. Elimination of all OPC lineage cells through A2B5+, O4+, and O1+ complement-mediated cell lysis resulted in a delay in development of MBP cells and myelination. Selective elimination of early OPCs (A2B5+) also unexpectedly resulted in delayed MBP expression compared to controls suggesting that early OPCs contribute to the timing of myelination onset. By contrast, elimination of differentiated (O1+) immature oligodendrocytes permanently inhibited the appearance of MBP+ cells suggesting that oligodendrocytes are critical to facilitate the maturation of OPCs. These data illuminate that the presence of intra-lineage feed-forward and feedback cues are important for timely myelination by oligodendrocytes.},

Single-molecule detection and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy in the nanopipet enable us to determine the number of molecules delivered. Anomalous slow diffusion of the DNA molecules in the pipet has also been observed.

We used dual laser excitation and dual color detection to simultaneously follow two fluorophore-labeled DNA sequences with millisecond time resolution, significantly faster than studies to date. A strong trapping effect was observed during the negative half cycle for all DNA samples and also the dCTP. This effect was maximum below 1 Hz and decreased with higher frequency. We assign this trapping to strong dielectrophoresis due to the high electric field and electric field gradient in the pipette tip. Dielectrophoresis in electrodeless tapered nanostructures has potential applications for controlled mixing and manipulation of short lengths of DNA and other biomolecules, opening new possibilities in miniaturized biological analysis.},

Initially, the soma, the dendrites and the growth cones of hippocampal neurons were imaged. The imaging force was adjusted to a small value for the long-term observation. The neural spines were damaged when the tip produced a large force; the spines regenerated after the force was reduced. Subsequently, we explored the relationship between structural changes in hippocampal neurons and Alzheimer's disease by employing the new imaging technique. Time-lapse image acquisition (10 min intervals) showed that the growth cone collapsed after the addition amyloid peptide fragment beta(25-35), which is thought to initiate Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we found substantial changes in mechanical properties and in the volume of individual growth cone. This study suggested that MAC mode AFM may be a powerful tool for observing long-term structural changes in living neural cells under physiological conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF or VEGF-A) and its receptors play essential roles in the formation of blood vessels during embryogenesis and in disease. Most biological effects of VEGF are mediated via two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, but specific VEGF isoforms also bind neuropilins (NP) 1 and 2, non-tyrosine kinase receptors originally identified as receptors for semaphorins, polypeptides with essential roles in neuronal patterning. There is abundant evidence that VEGF-A has neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects on neuronal and glial cells in culture and in vivo, and can stimulate the proliferation and survival of neural stem cells. VEGFR2 and NP1 are the major VEGF receptors expressed on neuronal cells and, while the mechanisms mediating neuroprotective effects of VEGF are not fully understood, VEGF stimulates several signalling events in neuronal cell types, including activation of phospholipase C-gamma, Akt and ERK. Findings in diverse models of nerve damage and disease suggest that VEGF has therapeutic potential as a neuroprotective factor. VEGF is a key mediator of the angiogenic response to cerebral and peripheral ischaemia, and promotes nerve repair following traumatic spinal injury. Recent work has revealed a role for reduced VEGF expression in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a rare neurodegenerative disease caused by selective loss of motor neurons. In many instances, the neuroprotective effects of VEGF appear to result from a combination of the indirect consequences of increased angiogenesis, and the direct stimulation of neuronal function. However, more work is required to determine the specific functional role of direct neuronal effects of VEGF.},

To dissect the respective signaling pathways and biological functions mediated by these receptors in primary endothelial cells with these two receptors intact, we developed a chimeric receptor system in which the N terminus of the epidermal growth factor receptor was fused to the transmembrane domain and intracellular domain of KDR (EGDR) and Flt-1 (EGLT). We observed that KDR, but not Flt-1, was responsible for VPF/VEGF-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and migration. Moreover, Flt-1 showed an inhibitory effect on KDR-mediated proliferation, but not migration. We also demonstrated that the inhibitory function of Flt-1 was mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)-dependent pathway because inhibitors of PI-3K as well as a dominant negative mutant of p85 (PI-3K subunit) reversed the inhibition, whereas a constitutively activated mutant of p110 introduced the inhibition to HUVEC-EGDR. We also observed that, in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVECs, the Flt-1/EGLT-mediated down-modulation of KDR/EGDR signaling was at or before intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization, but after KDR/EGDR phosphorylation. By mutational analysis, we further identified that the tyrosine 794 residue of Flt-1 was essential for its antiproliferative effect. Taken together, these studies contribute significantly to our understanding of the signaling pathways and biological functions triggered by KDR and Flt-1 and describe a unique mechanism in which PI-3K acts as a mediator of antiproliferation in primary vascular endothelium.},

  Abstract                 = {To function as a transport barrier a renal tubule epithelial monolayer needs to maintain its integrity when, sudden hypertonic stress causes cell shrinkage, new cells are added, or cells in the monolayer die. However, the mechanism used to achieve this is largely unknown. Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) has been shown to be suitable for imaging the surface of live renal cells with high topographic resolution, and can be used to elucidate how a functional renal epithelial monolayer maintains its integrity.SICM was used for high spatial resolution topographic imaging of Xenopuslaevis renal epithelial A6 cells cultured on membrane filter inserts.The SICM images of A6 cells showed that the epithelial monolayer maintains its integrity under hypertonic stress, and during cell division and death. Sequential SICM topographic images revealed detailed structural changes and their time course for these protective processes, which involve highly cooperative cell movement. Some "balloon-like" structures were observed at susceptible tight junction regions, which were proposed to help cell maintaining the monolayer permeability integrity.SICM is a powerful tool for research on living renal epithelial cells, and has been used to elucidate how a functional epithelial monolayer maintains its integrity. Using this technique we have observed that during hypertonic stress and regeneration, an organized sequence of events protect the loss of integrity of monolayer so that tight junctions and cell-cell contact are maintained and disruption to the function of whole monolayer is prevented.},

  Abstract                 = {Extracellular ATP initiates potent effects on sodium transport across renal epithelia through membrane-associated purinergic receptors. Dependent on the location of these receptors, ATP either inhibits or stimulates sodium reabsorption. Using A6 cells, transepithelial electrical resistance measurements, and scanning ion conductance microscopy, we have identified the purinergic receptors involved in the stimulatory action on the epithelial cell basolateral plasma membrane. Addition of the potent P2X(4) receptor agonist 2-methylthio-ATP (2MeSATP) to the basolateral side of the A6 monolayer stimulated amiloride-sensitive sodium conductance and produced similar cell morphological changes to those found with ATPgammaS, aldosterone, or hypotonic stress. The agonist potency order determined by sodium conductance changes of the monolayer was: 2MeSATP >or= ATPgammaS > CTP, a similar agonist potency profile to that of cloned P2X(4) receptors but with higher sensitivity for beta, gamma-methylene-ATP and alpha,beta-methylene-ATP. We further demonstrated that the ATP effect on sodium transport was potentiated by ivermectin, not blocked by suramin and PPADS, enhanced by Zn(2+) but not by Cu(2+), and significantly reduced but not totally inhibited by brilliant blue G. These results led us to conclude that basolateral P2X(4)-like receptors were involved. We suggest that there is a reciprocal purinergic system acting both at a basolateral and apical location for control of Na(+) transport. This requires a mechanism within the cell that leads to either basolateral or apical ATP release to regulate renal tubular function.},

  Abstract                 = {Neurogenesis, or the production of new neurons, is regulated by physiological and pathological processes including aging, stress, and brain injury. Many mitogenic and trophic factors that regulate proliferation of nonneuronal cells are also involved in neurogenesis. These include vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), which stimulates the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into neuronal precursor cells in vitro and in the adult rat brain in vivo. Using BrdU labeling as an index of cell proliferation, we found that the in vitro neuroproliferative effect of VEGF was associated with up-regulation of E2F family transcription factors, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cdc25. VEGF also increased nuclear expression of E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3, consistent with regulation of the G1/S phase transition of the cell cycle. The proliferative effect of VEGF was inhibited by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059, the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor GF102390X, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin, indicating involvement of multiple signaling pathways. These findings help to provide a molecular basis for some of the recently identified neuronal effects of VEGF.},

  abstract     = {Nanoparticles have the potential to become versatile tools in the medical and life sciences. One potential application is delivering drugs or other compounds to the cell cytoplasm, which requires the nanoparticles to bind to or cross the cell membrane. However, there are only a few tools available which allow studying the interaction of nanoparticles and the cell membrane of living cells in a physiological environment. Currently, the tool which least biases living cells is Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy (SICM). Specialized SICMs allow imaging at high resolution, however, they are cost intensive, particularly when providing a large field-of-view. In contrast, less cost intensive SICMs which provide a large field-of-view do not allow imaging at high resolutions. We have developed a SICM setup consisting of a compact three-axis piezo system and an additional fast shear-force piezo actor. This combination allows imaging fields-of-view of up to 80 μm × 80 μm, recording sections of living cells with a temporal resolution in the range of minutes as well as imaging with a spatial resolution of below 70 nm. Using our SICM we found that the cell membrane of HeLa cells treated with carboxylated latex nanoparticles was significantly more convoluted compared to control cells. The SICM setup we introduce here combines high resolution imaging with a large field-of-view at low costs. Our setup only requires a mounting adapter to extend existing inverted light microscopes, thus it could be a valuable and cost effective tool for researchers in all fields of the medical and life sciences performing investigations at the nanometer scale.},

The advent of superresolution optical microscopy techniques provides the possibility to augment EM with nanometer-resolution fluorescence microscopy to access the precise location of proteins in the context of cellular ultrastructure. Unfortunately, efforts to combine superresolution fluorescence and EM have been stymied by the divergent and incompatible sample preparation protocols of the two methods. Here, we describe a protocol that preserves both the delicate photoactivatable fluorescent protein labels essential for superresolution microscopy and the fine ultrastructural context of EM. This preparation enables direct 3D imaging in 500- to 750-nm sections with interferometric photoactivatable localization microscopy followed by scanning EM images generated by focused ion beam ablation. We use this process to “colorize” detailed EM images of the mitochondrion with the position of labeled proteins. The approach presented here has provided a new level of definition of the in vivo nature of organization of mitochondrial nucleoids, and we expect this straightforward method to be applicable to many other biological questions that can be answered by direct imaging.},

Contemporary optical microscopy (super resolution) techniques have also reached the nanometer scale resolution to visualize this and hence a combination of super resolution aided nano manipulation ineluctably gives a new perspective to the scenario. Here we demonstrate how specificity and rapid determination of structures provided by stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscope can aid another microscopic tool with capability of mechanical manoeuvring, like an atomic force microscope (AFM) to get topological information or to target nano scaled materials. We also give proof of principle on how high-resolution real time visualization can improve nano manipulation capability within a dense sample, and how STED-AFM is an optimal combination for this job. With these evidences, this article points to future precise nano dissections and maybe even to a nano-snooker game with an AFM tip and fluorospheres.},

Here, we present a method which combines stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution imaging and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to correlate cytoskeletal structural information with membrane physical properties in live astrocytes. Using STED compatible dyes for live cell imaging of the cytoskeleton, and simultaneously mapping the cell surface topology with AFM, we obtain unprecedented detail of highly organised networks of actin and microtubules in astrocytes. Combining mechanical data from AFM with optical imaging of actin and tubulin further reveals links between cytoskeleton organisation and membrane properties. Using this methodology we illustrate that scratch-induced migration induces cytoskeleton remodelling.  The latter is caused by a polarization of actin and microtubule elements within astroglial cell processes, which correlates strongly with changes in cell stiffness. The method opens new avenues for the dynamic probing of the membrane structural and functional plasticity of living brain cells. It is a powerful tool for providing new insights into mechanisms of cell structural remodeling during physiological or pathological processes, such as brain development or tumorigenesis.},

  abstract  = {We describe a method for the deposition of minute amounts of fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides with high local precision in conductive and transparent solid layers of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) doped with glycerin and cysteamine (PVA-G-C layers). Deposition of negatively charged fluorescent molecules was accomplished with a setup based on a scanning ion conductance microscope (SICM) using nanopipettes with tip diameters of ?100 nm by using the ion flux flowing between two electrodes through the nanopipette. To investigate the precision of the local deposition process, we performed in situ super-resolution microscopy by direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). Exploiting the single-molecule sensitivity and reliability of dSTORM, we determine the number of fluorescent molecules deposited in single spots. The correlation of applied charge and number of deposited molecules enables the quantification of delivered molecules by measuring the charge during the delivery process. We demonstrate the reproducible deposition of 3?168 fluorescent molecules in single spots and the creation of fluorescent structures. The fluorescent structures are highly stable and can be reused several times.},

Such a method requires the retention of specificity by the antibody-molecule during and after the necessary chemical manipulation, a stable chemical linkage between the antibody and its label, and a label that can be detected when present in minute quantities. A further important requirement demands the separation of the labelled-antibody solution from unconjugated tracer-material. In addition a method of this sort would obviously be more useful for many studies if it were possible to determine not only those organs, but those cells which contain the antigen in question. Accordingly we investigated the possibility of employing materials for labelling that could be detected by optical rather than by analytic or radiographic methods.},

Uptake of 99mTc-labeled phosphate was studied in an animal model of primary osteogenesis following tibial marrow injury and incorporation was correlated to that of calcium-47 (47Ca), phosphorus-32 (32P), and with matrix vesicle calcification. Isotope uptake on Day 6 in the whole bone was increased compared to controls. On this day, an increase in vesicular diameter and distance from the calcified front was previously observed. Technetium-99m-labeled phosphates were detected only in the organic phase. Phosphorus-32 and 47Ca were detected in both organic and inorganic phases. It is suggested that 99mTc serves as a specific marker to the anabolic phase of remodeling. Increased incorporation of 99mTc during bone healing indicates enhanced organic matrix formation and not calcification.},

  abstract     = {Cells are neither flat nor smooth, which has serious implications for prevailing plasma membrane models and cellular processes like cell signalling, adhesion and molecular clustering. Using probability distributions from diffusion simulations, we demonstrate that 2D and 3D Euclidean distance measurements substantially underestimate diffusion on non-flat surfaces. Intuitively, the shortest within surface distance (SWSD), the geodesic distance, should reduce this problem. The SWSD is accurate for foldable surfaces but, although it outperforms 2D and 3D Euclidean measurements, it still underestimates movement on deformed surfaces. We demonstrate that the reason behind the underestimation is that topographical features themselves can produce both super- and subdiffusion, i.e. the appearance of anomalous diffusion. Differentiating between topography-induced and genuine anomalous diffusion requires characterising the surface by simulating Brownian motion on high-resolution cell surface images and a comparison with the experimental data.},
