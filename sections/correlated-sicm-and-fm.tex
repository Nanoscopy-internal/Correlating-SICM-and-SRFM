Nevertheless SICM does not necessary being used for investigating the topography of a cell,

deposition of molecules, like fluorescently-labeled single stranded-DNA molecules 
\cite{Ying2002,Hennig2015}. The nanopipette could be also used for nanoinjection 
of fluorescently labeled molecules into living cells \cite{Hennig2015_nanoinj}. 
The SICM was therefore combined with wide-field and dSTORM microscopy, and mitochondria, 
actin and DNA could be successfully stained. One problem with the nanoinjection was that 
artifacts, due to the holes that were introduced into the membranes, could occur \cite{Hennig2015_nanoinj}.

SICM in combination with F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensors could be used for
the localisation of {$\beta_{1}$}-adrenoceptors \cite{Wright2018}, {$\beta_{2}$}-adrenoceptors 
\cite{Nikolaev2010,Lyon2012,Wright2014,Wright2018} and {$\beta_{3}$-adrenoceptors \cite{Schobesberger2020} 
in healthy and impaired cardiomyocytes \cite{Wright2015,Berisha2017}. After measuring the 
topography with SICM the nanopipette could be moved to
